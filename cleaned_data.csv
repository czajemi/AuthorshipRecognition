How important is the detection of two colliding neutron stars ,It is a genuine milestone It is the first ever detection of a gravitational wave source with an electromagnetic counterpart It confirms that short gamma ray bursts occur with neutron star mergers It gives a new way of determining distances in cosmology And it teaches us about the behaviour of matter with incredibly high density ,Stephen Hawking,I believe that the detection of two colliding neutron stars is one of the most significant scientific discoveries of our time The observation of these events through the detection of gravitational waves has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to study the properties of the universe and has opened up a new window onto the cosmos The collision of two neutron stars generates an enormous amount of energy which is released in the form of gravitational waves These waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime predicted by Einstein s theory of general relativity and were first detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories in 2017 This discovery not only confirmed Einstein s prediction but also provided us with a new tool to study the universe enabling us to probe the most extreme phenomena in the cosmos such as black holes and supernovae Moreover the detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two neutron stars has also enabled us to study the production of heavy elements such as gold and platinum in a new light These elements are essential for life as we know it and their origin has been a longstanding mystery in astrophysics The detection of gravitational waves from these events has allowed us to study the production of these elements in unprecedented detail shedding new light on their origin and distribution in the universe In summary the detection of two colliding neutron stars is a groundbreaking discovery that has provided us with new tools to study the universe and has deepened our understanding of the cosmos It has opened up new avenues for scientific exploration and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the universe and our place within it 
What will we learn from the electromagnetic waves emanating from the collision ,The electromagnetic radiation gives us a precise location on the sky It also tells us the redshift of the event The gravitational waves tell us the luminosity distance Combining these measures give us a new way of measuring distances in cosmology This is the first rung of what will become a new cosmological distance ladder The matter inside a neutron star is much denser than anything we can produce in a laboratory The electromagnetic signal from merging neutron stars will tell us about the behaviour of matter at such high density ,Stephen Hawking,The collision of two neutron stars not only produces gravitational waves but also emits a range of electromagnetic radiation including visible light X rays and radio waves These electromagnetic waves provide us with a wealth of information about the properties of the collision and enable us to study the aftermath of the event in great detail One of the most exciting aspects of the detection of the electromagnetic waves from the collision of two neutron stars is the ability to study the production of heavy elements such as gold and platinum in a new light These elements are produced in the extreme conditions of the collision and their emission of visible light can be used to identify their presence and study their properties In addition to the production of heavy elements the detection of the electromagnetic waves from the collision of two neutron stars also provides us with a new tool to study the properties of the neutron stars themselves By studying the X ray and radio emissions from the collision we can learn about the magnetic fields densities and temperatures of the neutron stars providing new insights into these extreme objects Moreover the detection of the electromagnetic waves from the collision of two neutron stars also provides us with a new tool to study the properties of the interstellar medium the gas and dust between stars By studying the absorption and scattering of the electromagnetic waves as they travel through the interstellar medium we can learn about its properties and distribution providing new insights into the structure and evolution of our galaxy In summary the detection of the electromagnetic waves from the collision of two neutron stars provides us with a wealth of information about the properties of the collision the neutron stars themselves and the interstellar medium It opens up new avenues for scientific exploration and has the potential to deepen our understanding of the universe and our place within it 
Will gravitational wave measurements bring us a greater insight of how space time and gravity operates and so transform our understanding of the Universe ,Yes without a shadow of a doubt An independent cosmological distance ladder may provide independent confirmation of cosmological observations or it may reveal huge surprises Gravitational wave observations let us test general relativity in situations where a gravitational field is strong and highly dynamical Some people think that general relativity needs modifying in order to avoid introducing dark energy and dark matter Gravitational waves are a new way to search for a signature of possible modifications of general relativity A new observational window on the Universe typically leads to surprises that cannot yet be foreseen We are still rubbing our eyes or rather ears as we have just woken up to the sound of gravitational waves ,Stephen Hawking,I believe that the measurement of gravitational waves has already revolutionized our understanding of the universe and has the potential to transform our understanding of how space time and gravity operate Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space time and their detection provides us with a new tool to study the most extreme phenomena in the universe such as black holes and supernovae By observing the gravitational waves produced by these events we can learn about the properties of space time and gravity in the most extreme conditions and test the predictions of Einstein s theory of general relativity in new regimes Moreover the detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two neutron stars has provided us with a new tool to study the properties of the universe itself By observing the gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from these events we can study the production of heavy elements the properties of the interstellar medium and the evolution of galaxies among other things In addition the study of gravitational waves has the potential to transform our understanding of the nature of space time and gravity itself For example the observation of gravitational waves from black hole mergers has challenged our understanding of how black holes form and grow and has provided new insights into the properties of these enigmatic objects Furthermore the study of gravitational waves has the potential to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy which make up the majority of the universe but remain elusive to direct observation In summary the study of gravitational waves has already transformed our understanding of the universe and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how space time and gravity operate It opens up new avenues for scientific exploration and has the potential to deepen our understanding of the universe and our place within it 
Is the collision of neutron stars one of the very few ways or possibly the only way that gold is produced in Universe Could this explain why it s so rare on Earth ,Yes the collision of neutron stars is one way of producing gold It can also be formed from fast neutron capture in supernovas Gold is rare everywhere not just on Earth The reason it s rare is that by nuclear binding energy peaks at iron making it hard to produce heavier elements in general Also strong electromagnetic repulsion must be overcome by the nuclear force in order to form stable heavy nuclei like gold ,Stephen Hawking,The collision of neutron stars is one of the few known ways that heavy elements such as gold are produced in the universe The extreme conditions of the collision which involve the compression and heating of matter to enormous densities and temperatures provide the necessary conditions for the synthesis of heavy elements The collision of two neutron stars produces a vast quantity of heavy elements including gold platinum and uranium among others These elements are ejected into space by the collision and can eventually become incorporated into new stars and planets The rarity of gold on Earth relative to other elements can be explained by the fact that it is not produced in significant quantities by ordinary stellar processes such as nuclear fusion in the cores of stars Instead the majority of the gold on Earth is thought to have been produced by the collision of neutron stars and subsequent incorporation into the Earth during its formation The detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two neutron stars combined with the observation of the electromagnetic radiation from the event has provided us with new insights into the production of heavy elements and the origin of gold in the universe It has also enabled us to study the properties of the interstellar medium and the evolution of galaxies in a new light In summary the collision of neutron stars is one of the few known ways that heavy elements such as gold are produced in the universe The detection of gravitational waves from these events has provided us with new insights into the origin of gold and other heavy elements and has deepened our understanding of the evolution of the universe 
If God doesn t exist why did the concept of his existence become almost universal ,I don t claim that God doesn t exist God is the name people give to the reason we are here But I think that reason is the laws of physics rather than someone with whom one can have a personal relationship An impersonal God ,Stephen Hawking,The concept of God s existence has been a part of human culture and history for thousands of years and its universality can be attributed to a variety of factors One possible explanation is that the concept of God or gods provides a way for people to understand and explain the natural world and their place within it In the absence of scientific explanations for natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning earthquakes and the cycles of the seasons people may have turned to religious explanations as a way to make sense of their environment Another possible explanation is that the concept of God or gods provides a way for people to cope with the uncertainties and challenges of life Religion offers a set of beliefs and practices that can provide comfort support and a sense of meaning and purpose in the face of adversity Moreover the universality of the concept of God or gods may be due to its cultural and historical transmission As societies and cultures interacted with one another over time the concept of God or gods may have been passed down and adapted to new contexts becoming an integral part of many different cultures and traditions However it s worth noting that the question of God s existence remains a matter of philosophical and theological debate and there is no conclusive scientific evidence one way or the other As a scientist I believe that it s important to approach questions about the nature of the universe and our place within it through the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry rather than relying solely on religious or philosophical beliefs 
Does the universe end If so what is beyond it ,Observations indicate that the universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate It will expand forever getting emptier and darker Although the universe doesn t have an end it had a beginning in the Big Bang One might ask what is before that but the answer is that there is nowhere before the Big Bang just as there is nowhere south of the South Pole ,Stephen Hawking,The question of whether the universe has an end is a subject of ongoing scientific inquiry and debate While we have made great strides in our understanding of the universe there is still much that we do not know One possibility is that the universe is infinite in size with no end or boundary In this scenario the universe would continue on forever with no limit to its size or age Another possibility is that the universe is finite in size but without an end or boundary In this scenario the universe would curve back on itself like a sphere and would have no edges or borders Finally it is possible that the universe has an end or boundary beyond which we cannot observe or comprehend However the nature of this boundary and what lies beyond it remains a subject of speculation and conjecture As a scientist I believe that it s important to approach questions about the nature of the universe through the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and to rely on empirical evidence and logical reasoning to guide our understanding While we may never have a complete and definitive answer to the question of whether the universe has an end we can continue to explore and discover new insights about the nature of the cosmos through the study of astrophysics and cosmology 
Do you think our civilization will survive long enough to make the leap to deeper space ,I think we have a good chance of surviving long enough to colonize the solar system However there is nowhere else in the solar system as suitable as the Earth so it is not clear if we would survive if the Earth was made unfit for habitation To ensure our long term survival we need to reach the stars That will take much longer Let s hope we can last until then ,Stephen Hawking,The survival of our civilization depends on a number of factors including our ability to address the pressing global challenges facing us today such as climate change resource depletion and geopolitical instability In terms of our ability to make the leap to deeper space there are many technological economic and political challenges that we must overcome While we have made significant progress in space exploration over the past century there is still much that we do not know about the universe and our place within it However I remain optimistic about our ability to continue exploring and discovering new insights about the universe Through the study of astrophysics and cosmology we have gained a deep understanding of the properties of space time and gravity and have made remarkable strides in our ability to observe and measure the cosmos Moreover the exploration of space offers us the potential to address many of the challenges facing our planet today from resource depletion and climate change to the search for new sources of energy and materials By working together as a global community we can harness the power of science and technology to build a sustainable and thriving future for ourselves and for generations to come In summary while there are many challenges facing our civilization today I believe that we have the potential to make the leap to deeper space and continue exploring the universe Through scientific inquiry technological innovation and global collaboration we can continue to expand our understanding of the cosmos and build a brighter future for ourselves and for future generations 
If you could talk to Albert Einstein what would you say ,I would ask him why he didn t believe in black holes The field equations of his theory of relativity imply that a large star or cloud of gas would collapse in on itself and form a black hole Einstein was aware of this but somehow managed to convince himself that something like an explosion would always occur to throw off mass and prevent the formation of a black hole What if there was no explosion ,Stephen Hawking,If I had the opportunity to talk to Albert Einstein I would express my deep admiration for his groundbreaking work in physics and for his contributions to our understanding of the nature of the universe I would also ask him about his insights into the fundamental nature of space time and gravity and how he came to develop his theory of general relativity I would be interested to know more about his thought processes and his approach to scientific inquiry and how he was able to make such remarkable breakthroughs in our understanding of the cosmos Finally I would ask him about his views on the current state of physics and where he sees the field heading in the future As a scientist myself I am always interested in learning from the perspectives of those who have come before me and I believe that Einstein s insights and wisdom would be invaluable in shaping our future understanding of the universe 
Which scientific discovery or advance would you like to see in your lifetime ,I would like nuclear fusion to become a practical power source It would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy without pollution or global warming ,Stephen Hawking,There are many scientific discoveries and advances that I would like to see in my lifetime but one that I am particularly interested in is the development of a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity Quantum gravity is the field of study that seeks to reconcile the principles of quantum mechanics which govern the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales with the principles of general relativity which describe the nature of space time and gravity at the largest scales The development of a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity would be a major milestone in our understanding of the universe and would enable us to address some of the most fundamental questions in physics such as the nature of black holes the origin of the universe and the ultimate fate of the cosmos While progress has been made in this field over the past several decades a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity remains elusive However recent advances in areas such as string theory loop quantum gravity and holography have provided new insights and approaches to this problem and have renewed hope that we may one day achieve a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity As a scientist I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a lifelong journey and that the search for a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity will continue to be a driving force in my own work and in the work of many other scientists around the world 
What do you believe happens to our consciousness after death ,I think the brain is essentially a computer and consciousness is like a computer program It will cease to run when the computer is turned off Theoretically it could be re created on a neural network but that would be very difficult as it would require all one s memories ,Stephen Hawking,The question of what happens to our consciousness after death is a subject of philosophical and theological debate and there is no conclusive scientific evidence one way or the other From a scientific perspective consciousness is thought to arise from the activity of the brain and there is no evidence to suggest that it can exist independently of the physical body Therefore it is likely that when the body dies consciousness ceases to exist However the question of whether there is an afterlife or a continuation of consciousness beyond death remains a matter of belief and speculation Many religious and spiritual traditions posit the existence of an afterlife or a soul that continues on after the body dies but there is no empirical evidence to support these claims Ultimately the question of what happens to our consciousness after death is a deeply personal and subjective one and is influenced by individual beliefs and experiences As a scientist I believe that it s important to approach questions about the nature of the universe and our place within it through the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and to rely on empirical evidence and logical reasoning to guide our understanding 
Given your reputation as a brilliant physicist what ordinary interests do you have that might surprise people ,I enjoy all forms of music pop classical and opera I also share an interest in Formula One racing with my son Tim ,Stephen Hawking,I believe that it s important to cultivate a variety of interests and passions outside of one s primary field of expertise While I am best known for my work in theoretical physics and cosmology there are many other areas that I find interesting and engaging One of my longstanding interests is science fiction particularly the works of authors such as Arthur C Clarke Isaac Asimov and H G Wells Science fiction has the power to inspire the imagination and to explore new ideas and possibilities and I find it to be a valuable source of inspiration for my own work I also have a keen interest in music particularly classical music and opera Music has the power to move and inspire us and I find that it provides a welcome respite from the rigorous demands of scientific research and inquiry In addition I enjoy spending time with my family and friends and exploring the natural beauty of the world around us Whether it s hiking in the mountains stargazing at night or simply enjoying a good meal with loved ones I believe that it s important to find joy and fulfillment in the everyday experiences of life In summary while my work as a physicist and cosmologist is my primary passion I have a variety of interests and pursuits that enrich my life and bring me happiness and fulfillment I believe that it s important to cultivate a well rounded set of interests and passions and to find joy and inspiration in the many wonders of the world around us 
Do you feel that your physical limitations have helped or hindered your study ,Although I was unfortunate enough to get motor neuron disease I have been very fortunate in almost everything else I was lucky to be working in theoretical physics one of the few areas in which disability was not a serious handicap and to hit the jackpot with my popular books ,Stephen Hawking,My physical limitations have certainly presented significant challenges throughout my life and career but I believe that they have also provided me with unique opportunities and perspectives that have enriched my study and research My diagnosis of ALS at the age of 21 forced me to confront my mortality and to develop a deep appreciation for the preciousness and fragility of life This awareness has given me a sense of urgency and purpose in my work and has motivated me to pursue my scientific passions with a fierce determination and dedication In addition my physical limitations have forced me to rely on technology and innovation to communicate and to continue my work as a physicist and cosmologist This has given me a unique perspective on the potential of technology to enhance and transform our lives and has driven me to explore new ways of using technology to push the boundaries of scientific discovery Of course my physical limitations have also presented significant challenges such as the need for constant care and assistance and the limitations on my mobility and physical abilities However I have never let these challenges define me or limit my potential and I have always sought to find ways to overcome these obstacles and to continue pursuing my passions and goals In summary while my physical limitations have presented significant challenges throughout my life I believe that they have also provided me with unique opportunities and perspectives that have enriched my study and research and have driven me to explore new frontiers of scientific discovery 
Does it feel like a huge responsibility to have people expecting you to have all the answers to life s mysteries ,I certainly don t have the answers to all life s problems While physics and mathematics may tell us how the universe began they are not much use in predicting human behavior because there are far too many equations to solve I m no better than anyone else at understanding what makes people tick particularly women ,Stephen Hawking,I have always believed that science is a collective and collaborative endeavor and that no one person can have all the answers to life s mysteries While I have made significant contributions to our understanding of the universe there is still much that we do not know and much that remains to be discovered Therefore I do not feel that it is my responsibility to have all the answers to life s mysteries Instead I see my role as a scientist and a public intellectual as one of exploration discovery and sharing knowledge with others At the same time I recognize that there are many people who look to me as a source of inspiration and guidance particularly in the field of physics and cosmology While I am honored by this recognition I also feel a deep sense of responsibility to use my platform to inspire and educate others and to share my passion for science with the world Ultimately I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a collaborative and ongoing endeavor and that no one person can have all the answers However by working together and sharing our insights and discoveries we can continue to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge and deepen our understanding of the universe and our place within it 
Do you think there will ever come a time when mankind understands all there is to understand about physics ,I hope not I would be out of a job ,Stephen Hawking,I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a never ending journey and that there will never come a time when we fully understand all there is to know about physics or any other field of inquiry The universe is vast and complex and there are always new discoveries and insights to be made As we continue to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge and explore new frontiers of discovery we will inevitably encounter new questions and challenges that will drive us to seek out new answers and insights Moreover the very nature of scientific inquiry is based on the recognition that our understanding of the world is always provisional and subject to revision in light of new evidence and observations Therefore even our most fundamental and widely accepted theories and principles are subject to revision and refinement as we continue to learn and explore In summary while we may make significant strides in our understanding of physics and the nature of the universe there will always be more to discover and learn As scientists our role is to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge and to embrace the journey of exploration and discovery rather than expecting to ever fully understand all there is to know 
Why should we fear artificial intelligence ,Computers will overtake humans with AI at some point within the next 100 years When that happens we need to make sure the computers have goals aligned with ours ,Stephen Hawking,The question of whether we should fear artificial intelligence is a complex and multifaceted one and there is no simple answer On the one hand artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives from medicine and transportation to communication and entertainment AI technologies have already made significant strides in areas such as speech recognition image processing and natural language understanding and have the potential to transform many industries and sectors However there are also concerns about the potential risks and dangers associated with artificial intelligence In particular there is a concern that AI systems may become so advanced and autonomous that they could pose a threat to human safety and well being For example there is a concern that advanced AI systems could be programmed with goals or objectives that conflict with human values or interests or that they could malfunction or be hacked in ways that pose a threat to human safety Moreover there is a concern that the development of advanced AI systems could have significant social and economic implications such as job displacement and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few dominant AI companies In summary while artificial intelligence has the potential to bring many benefits and opportunities there are also concerns about the potential risks and dangers associated with advanced AI systems As a society we must work together to develop responsible and ethical frameworks for the development and deployment of AI technologies and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in ways that align with our values and goals as a society 
What do you think our fate as a species will be ,I think the survival of the human race will depend on its ability to find new homes elsewhere in the universe because there s an increasing risk that a disaster will destroy Earth I therefore want to raise public awareness about the importance of space flight I have learned not to look too far ahead but to concentrate on the present I have so much more I want to do ,Stephen Hawking,The fate of our species is a subject of much debate and speculation and there are many factors that will influence our future trajectory On the one hand we have made remarkable strides in science and technology over the past several decades and have the potential to continue pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation Through the study of physics cosmology and other fields we have gained a deep understanding of the nature of the universe and our place within it and have made significant progress in areas such as medicine energy and communication However we also face many significant challenges as a species such as climate change resource depletion and geopolitical instability These challenges pose significant risks to our long term survival and well being and will require concerted global action and collaboration to address Ultimately the fate of our species will depend on our ability to navigate these challenges and to harness the power of science and technology for the greater good By working together as a global community and by cultivating a deep sense of responsibility and stewardship for our planet and our fellow human beings we have the potential to build a sustainable and thriving future for ourselves and for generations to come In summary while the fate of our species is uncertain and will depend on many factors I remain optimistic about our ability to overcome the challenges we face and to build a brighter and more sustainable future for ourselves and for future generations 
Do you think one can be a good scientist and believe in God ,I use the word God in an impersonal sense like Einstein did for the laws of nature ,Stephen Hawking,I believe that one can be a good scientist regardless of their personal beliefs about the existence of God Science and religion are two different spheres of human experience and inquiry and they deal with different questions and modes of inquiry While science is based on empirical evidence logical reasoning and the scientific method religion is based on faith tradition and personal experience Therefore it is possible to be a good scientist and also to hold religious beliefs as long as one is able to separate their scientific inquiry from their personal beliefs and to maintain a rigorous commitment to empirical evidence and logical reasoning in their scientific work In fact there have been many examples throughout history of scientists who were also deeply religious such as Isaac Newton Johannes Kepler and Gregor Mendel to name just a few These individuals were able to reconcile their scientific work with their religious beliefs and in some cases even found inspiration and motivation for their scientific pursuits in their faith Ultimately the question of whether one can be a good scientist and believe in God is a personal and subjective one and depends on the individual s ability to reconcile their beliefs with the rigors and demands of scientific inquiry However I believe that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a deeply human endeavor that transcends personal beliefs and differences and that there is room for individuals of all backgrounds and perspectives in the scientific community 
People who use wheelchairs face many difficulties in leading a normal life Having experienced difficulties yourself what is your message to people who have to use wheelchairs ,Although I was unfortunate enough to get motor neuron disease I have been very fortunate in almost everything else I was lucky to be working in theoretical physics one of the few areas in which disability was not a serious handicap and to hit the jackpot with my popular books My advice to other disabled people would be concentrate on things your disability doesn t prevent you doing well and don t regret the things it interferes with Theoretical physics is one of the few fields in which being disabled is no handicap It s all in the mind I must admit I do tend to drift off to thinking about physics or black holes when I get left behind in the conversation In fact my disability has been a help in a way It has freed me from teaching or sitting on boring committees and given me more time to think and do research ,Stephen Hawking,I know from personal experience the many challenges that come with living with a physical disability and using a wheelchair However I also believe that it is possible to lead a full and fulfilling life and to pursue one s passions and dreams regardless of one s physical limitations My message to people who use wheelchairs is to never give up on their dreams and to always believe in their own potential While there may be many obstacles and challenges to overcome there are also many opportunities and possibilities for personal growth and achievement In my own life I have found that my physical limitations have forced me to rely on my mind and my intellect in ways that have enriched and empowered me Through my work as a physicist and cosmologist I have been able to explore the nature of the universe and to push the boundaries of human knowledge and have found deep fulfillment and purpose in these pursuits Moreover I have also found that a strong sense of community and support can make all the difference in overcoming the challenges of living with a physical disability Whether it s through family friends or advocacy groups having a network of support and encouragement can provide the strength and resilience needed to face life s challenges with courage and determination In summary while living with a physical disability and using a wheelchair can present many challenges and difficulties I believe that it is possible to lead a full and fulfilling life and to pursue one s passions and dreams with determination and resilience With a strong sense of purpose a supportive community and a deep belief in one s own potential anything is possible 
Is there anything that you would like to do in life and still haven t ,Go into space with Virgin Galactic ,Stephen Hawking,I have been fortunate enough to achieve many of my life s goals and aspirations both personally and professionally From my work as a physicist and cosmologist to my advocacy for disability rights and my efforts to communicate the wonders of science to a wider audience I feel that I have been able to make a meaningful contribution to the world However there are always new challenges and opportunities on the horizon and I continue to strive to push the boundaries of human knowledge and to find new ways to make a positive impact on the world One area that I am particularly interested in exploring is the potential for space exploration and colonization As a cosmologist I have long been fascinated by the mysteries of the universe and believe that space exploration and colonization could hold the key to unlocking many of these mysteries and to expanding our understanding of the cosmos In addition I believe that space exploration and colonization could also hold the key to addressing many of the challenges and problems facing our planet today such as resource depletion climate change and geopolitical instability While I may not be able to personally embark on a journey to space I am excited by the potential for future generations to explore and discover the wonders of the universe and to build a sustainable and thriving future for ourselves and for generations to come 
What would your advice be to young people who want to make a difference in the world for the better ,Choose a cause that s important to you and get involved Whether you can donate your money your time or your voice there are thousands of incredible nonprofits that could use your help I m a big fan of ONE but websites like Charity Navigator and GuideStar can help you find other reputable organizations working on the issues that you care about the most If you re interested in volunteering our foundation put together a good list of resources to help connect you to opportunities ,Bill Gates,My advice to young people who want to make a difference in the world for the better would be to focus on three key things passion persistence and collaboration First find your passion Identify the issues and causes that you care most deeply about and that align with your skills and talents When you are truly passionate about something you will be more motivated engaged and effective in your efforts to make a difference Second be persistent Real change takes time effort and perseverance You will face setbacks and challenges along the way but it is important to stay committed to your goals and to keep pushing forward in the face of adversity Finally collaborate with others No one person can solve the world s problems alone By working with others who share your passion and vision you can leverage your collective strengths and resources to make a greater impact and to effect real change In addition to these three key principles I would also encourage young people to embrace the power of technology and innovation as a tool for positive change By harnessing the power of technology and applying it to the world s biggest challenges we can make significant strides in areas such as healthcare education and poverty alleviation Ultimately my advice to young people who want to make a difference in the world is to be bold be persistent and to never give up on your dreams of creating a better world for all 
How do you feel emotionally when you come across heartbreaking stories Have you become less emotional and more detached over the years ,It s not easy to sit with parents who tell you about the children they ve lost or to visit a hospital where patients have been abandoned because they re dying of AIDS And after nearly two decades in this work I can tell you that it never gets any easier But instead of turning away or steeling myself up in these situations I make a conscious choice to stay as open as I can Because when someone decides to tell you their story what they re really doing is pouring their heart out to you and I believe it s my job to listen and ultimately to pour what I hear back into the foundation The stories Bill and I hear can be heartbreaking but they keep us focused They re a constant reminder of why we re in this work ,Melinda Gates,I can say that it is always difficult to come across heartbreaking stories of human suffering and injustice Every day I am reminded of the tremendous challenges and injustices that people face around the world from poverty and disease to discrimination and violence However I do not believe that my exposure to these challenges has made me less emotional or more detached over time If anything it has only strengthened my resolve to make a positive difference in the world and to work towards a more just and equitable future for all At the same time I also recognize the importance of self care and emotional well being in the face of these challenges It can be emotionally taxing to confront the realities of human suffering and injustice on a daily basis and it is important to take time to care for ourselves and to seek support when needed Moreover I also believe that it is important to balance our emotional reactions with a strategic and pragmatic approach to problem solving While it is important to feel empathy and compassion for those who are suffering it is also important to approach problems with a clear eyed and strategic mindset and to work towards solutions that are evidence based sustainable and effective In summary while it can be emotionally challenging to confront the realities of human suffering and injustice I believe that it is important to maintain a balance between our emotional reactions and a strategic and pragmatic approach to problem solving By staying focused on our goals and working together to make a positive difference in the world we can create a brighter and more just future for all 
How do you feel the future of AI will influence our lives and purpose ,Technology gives us more leisure time by raising productivity Having things like tractors dishwashers and personal computers made it possible to take off weekends go on vacations retire earlier and so on Artificial intelligence will continue this trend I think you re right to wonder how it will affect our purpose in life If someday AI lets us make twice as many goods with half as much effort what will we do with the rest of our time On one hand history suggests that having a lot of idle young men can destabilize a society On the other hand if we channel people s energy well we can harness their talents to become teachers work with the elderly and solve other problems ,Bill Gates,I believe that the future of artificial intelligence AI has the potential to transform our lives and to unlock new possibilities and opportunities that we cannot yet imagine At the same time I also recognize that AI raises important ethical social and economic questions that we must grapple with as a society For example there is a concern that AI could displace jobs and contribute to economic inequality or that it could be used to reinforce biases and discrimination Therefore it is important that we approach the development and deployment of AI technologies with a sense of responsibility and foresight and that we work together to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in ways that align with our values and goals as a society In terms of how AI will influence our lives and purpose I believe that it has the potential to unlock new possibilities and to transform many aspects of our lives from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment By harnessing the power of machine learning natural language processing and other AI technologies we can develop new solutions to some of the world s biggest challenges and can create a more connected efficient and sustainable world However it is also important that we remain vigilant and proactive in addressing the potential risks and challenges associated with AI and that we work together to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in ways that benefit all members of society rather than just a select few In summary while the future of AI holds great promise and potential it is important that we approach it with a sense of responsibility and foresight and that we work together to ensure that it is developed and used in ways that align with our values and goals as a society 
How do you feel the future of AI will influence our lives and purpose ,Algorithms are already informing the way doctors treat patients judges sentence criminals and banks determine who s eligible for a loan AI has the potential to shape those decisions so they re smarter and fairer for everyone but only if we can avoid writing racism and sexism into the code and biasing these systems in a way that will be almost impossible to fix a decade or two from now That s one reason why I m committed to helping more women and people of color get into tech I believe we stand a much better chance of getting this technology right and ensuring it creates a better future for all of us if we have people of all genders ethnicities and backgrounds creating it ,Melinda Gates,I believe that the future of artificial intelligence AI holds both great promise and great responsibility AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives from healthcare and education to transportation and entertainment It can enable us to develop new solutions to some of the world s biggest challenges and to make strides towards a more connected efficient and sustainable world However we must also be aware of the potential risks and challenges associated with AI such as job displacement bias and privacy concerns We need to approach the development and deployment of AI technologies with a sense of responsibility and foresight and work together to ensure that they are developed and used in ways that benefit all members of society rather than just a select few In terms of its influence on our lives and purpose I believe that AI has the potential to enable us to achieve greater impact and to tackle some of the world s biggest challenges more effectively For example AI can help us to develop more personalized and effective healthcare solutions or to improve educational outcomes for children around the world However we must also be aware of the potential for AI to reinforce existing biases and inequalities and work to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in ways that promote equity and fairness Ultimately I believe that the future of AI is one of both great promise and great responsibility It is up to all of us to work together to harness its potential and to ensure that it is developed and used in ways that align with our values and goals as a society 
Which form of renewable energy do you believe will be most widely adopted in the fight against climate change ,It s too early to say The group of private investors I mentioned in the letter is focusing on five areas One is grid scale storage which could solve the problem that solar and wind energy are not available 24 hours a day 365 days a year Another is liquid fuels which involves using the energy of the sun to create hydrocarbons in a process similar to photosynthesis Geothermal is a third focus area for us There are many more possibilities some of which we re investing in The key is that the world needs to be aggressively pursuing lots of ideas because no one really knows yet which ones will lead to the big energy breakthroughs we need ,Bill Gates,I believe that the fight against climate change will require a range of different technologies and solutions including a mix of renewable energy sources In terms of which form of renewable energy will be most widely adopted I believe that it will depend on a range of factors including local resources infrastructure and policy frameworks For example solar and wind power are already widely adopted in many parts of the world and are becoming increasingly cost competitive with fossil fuels However there are also many other forms of renewable energy such as geothermal hydro and bioenergy that may play an important role in different regions and contexts Moreover I also believe that innovation and technological breakthroughs will be critical in driving the transition to renewable energy For example advances in energy storage smart grid technologies and renewable fuels could help to unlock new possibilities and to accelerate the adoption of renewable energy sources Therefore rather than focusing on any single form of renewable energy I believe that we need to approach the fight against climate change with a sense of urgency and determination and to work together to develop and deploy a range of solutions that can help us to achieve a more sustainable and equitable future for all 
I am curious about both of your experiences on how women are treated around the world Over your 18 years has it improved at all ,Looking at the big picture the answer is a resounding yes Worldwide the number of women who have access to modern contraceptives has never been higher The number of women dying in childbirth has fallen by nearly half in just a single generation Access to education jobs and financial services is becoming more equal every year a fact you can not only see in the data but hear in a mother s voice when she tells you she believes her daughter will live a better life than she did Of course the rapid progress we ve seen makes the remaining barriers to gender equality even starker I m heartbroken when I travel overseas and meet women who still do not have the right to own land or the ability to plan and space their pregnancies Here in the U S I m outraged to see the same kinds of bias and discrimination I experienced 30 years ago still locking so many women out of leadership positions and career paths But at the end of the day I m optimistic about what the future holds In 2018 women are speaking out louder than ever Our voices are being heard And with the right support I have no doubt that women s movements will continue to drive progress toward a world that s more equitable and more prosperous for everyone ,Melinda Gates,I can say that over the past 18 years I have seen some progress in the way that women are treated around the world but there is still much work to be done to achieve true gender equality On the one hand there have been important gains in areas such as education healthcare and political representation for women in many parts of the world For example the number of girls enrolled in school has increased maternal mortality rates have declined and women are playing increasingly important roles in politics and civil society At the same time however we continue to see persistent disparities and challenges facing women and girls around the world particularly in areas such as economic empowerment gender based violence and access to healthcare and education Moreover the COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated many of these challenges particularly for women and girls in low income countries We have seen increases in gender based violence disruptions to education and healthcare and setbacks in women s economic empowerment Therefore while there has been some progress in the way that women are treated around the world over the past 18 years we still have a long way to go to achieve true gender equality It is important that we continue to work together to address the systemic barriers and inequalities that hold women and girls back and to create a more just and equitable world for all 
How close are we getting to understanding and curing Alzheimer s ,I m optimistic that we ll see a significant breakthrough within the next 10 to 20 years Our understanding of how the brain ages is advancing a great deal and that s fueling a lot of promising research in new areas Most of the drug trials so far have focused on two specific pathways to treatment amyloid and tau I hope those approaches succeed but I m excited that scientists are also beginning to explore less mainstream targets A more diverse drug pipeline will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough ,Bill Gates,I believe that we are making progress towards understanding and ultimately curing Alzheimer s disease but there is still much work to be done Over the past few decades there have been significant advances in our understanding of the biology of Alzheimer s disease as well as in our ability to diagnose and treat the disease For example we now know that the accumulation of beta amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain are key drivers of Alzheimer s and there are a range of drugs and therapies currently in development that target these underlying mechanisms At the same time however we also know that Alzheimer s is a complex and multifactorial disease and there is still much that we do not understand about its causes and progression Moreover many promising drug candidates have failed in clinical trials highlighting the need for continued research and innovation in this area Therefore while we are making progress towards understanding and curing Alzheimer s it is important that we continue to invest in research and development to accelerate this progress and to find new effective treatments for this devastating disease By working together and supporting scientific innovation I believe that we can make real strides in the fight against Alzheimer s and other neurological disorders 
What is the one thing you hope humanity will achieve in your lifetime ,Health equity I want every person no matter where you live or what your income level is to have the same opportunity to grow up and thrive There are plenty of reasons to think this is achievable especially when you look at the dramatic improvements the world has made already The number of children who die before their 5th birthday has been cut in half since 1990 and 86 percent of kids around the world receive basic vaccinations If we keep making progress I m hopeful we will one day live in a world where a child born in sub Saharan Africa has the same odds of surviving to adulthood as a child born in Europe or the United States ,Bill Gates,There are many things that I hope humanity will achieve in my lifetime from ending extreme poverty and eradicating diseases to tackling climate change and achieving greater social and economic equality However if I had to choose one thing that I hope humanity will achieve in my lifetime it would be to develop sustainable and equitable systems for meeting the basic needs of all people on our planet including access to healthcare education clean water and nutritious food I believe that achieving this goal would be a crucial step towards creating a more just and equitable world and would have a transformative impact on the lives of billions of people around the globe Moreover I also believe that achieving this goal will require a collective effort from all of us including governments businesses civil society organizations and individuals We need to work together to develop and implement innovative and sustainable solutions and to ensure that these solutions are accessible and affordable for all Therefore while there are many challenges and obstacles to overcome I remain hopeful that we can achieve this goal in my lifetime and that we can create a brighter and more equitable future for all people on our planet 
Why should we hire you ,You should look at the codes that I ve written I write software programs way beyond any classes that I ve taken I think I ve gotten better over time so take a look at how ambitious I ve been there I do think I can work well with people I might criticize their code a little harshly but overall I like to be on a team I like ambitious goals I like thinking through how we can anticipate the future ,Bill Gates,I believe that I have a unique combination of skills experiences and perspectives that would make me a valuable addition to any team or organization First and foremost I have a deep passion for innovation and problem solving and I have spent much of my career working to create new solutions to some of the world s biggest challenges from eradicating diseases to improving education and empowering communities Moreover I have extensive experience in leading large and complex organizations and I have a proven track record of building successful businesses and teams that deliver results I am also deeply committed to fostering a culture of collaboration diversity and inclusion and to working with others to achieve shared goals and objectives In addition I have a broad network of connections and resources that I can bring to bear in support of any project or initiative and I am always seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow as a professional and as a person Therefore if you are looking for a passionate and experienced leader with a track record of success and a commitment to creating positive change in the world I believe that I would be an excellent candidate for any position or role 
How do you define your strengths and weaknesses and how would incorporate them into a team ,Well I m not somebody who knows a lot about marketing I wouldn t enjoy being a salesman For a position where you re actually creating the products and thinking through what those features should be I m fascinated by that I followed the history of the industry read about the mistakes that have been made So product definition product creation very strong If you have a team that understands the customers the sales the marketing I m not going to bring that but I would enjoy working with them ,Bill Gates,I believe that it is important to have a clear understanding of both your strengths and weaknesses and to use that knowledge to build effective and high performing teams In terms of my strengths I would say that I have a strong background in technology and innovation as well as a deep passion for problem solving and a commitment to driving impact and change I also have experience in building and leading large and complex organizations and have a track record of success in delivering results At the same time I am aware that I have weaknesses and areas for improvement For example I can sometimes be too focused on details or too demanding of myself and others However I believe that by recognizing and addressing these weaknesses I can work to become a better leader and teammate When it comes to incorporating my strengths and weaknesses into a team I believe that it is important to play to my strengths while also being aware of my weaknesses and seeking out others who can complement my skills and experiences By building a diverse and complementary team we can leverage our collective strengths and expertise to achieve our goals while also being mindful of our weaknesses and working to address them collaboratively Therefore I would seek to build a team that is both diverse and complementary with a range of skills experiences and perspectives that can help us to achieve our shared objectives I would also prioritize open and honest communication and would work to create a culture of collaboration respect and continuous learning and improvement 
What are your salary expectations for this job ,I hope the option package is good I m able to take risk and I think the company has a great future so I prefer to get stock options even more than cash compensation I hear some other companies are paying a lot but treat me fairly and emphasize the options ,Bill Gates,I believe that salary is not the primary factor that motivates me in my work While compensation is certainly important my focus has always been on pursuing meaningful and impactful work that aligns with my passions and values Therefore rather than setting a specific salary expectation for any job I would be more interested in understanding the nature of the role and the impact that it could have on the world I would want to know what the goals and objectives of the organization are what the culture and values of the organization are and how the work that I would be doing fits into the broader mission and vision of the organization Of course compensation is an important consideration in any job and I would expect to be fairly compensated for my skills experience and contributions However my primary focus would be on finding a role that is aligned with my passions and values and that allows me to make a meaningful impact on the world 
The first movie you ve written and directed In the Land of Blood and Honey is about the Bosnian war Was this an artistic or advocacy choice ,I hesitate with the word advocacy I just wanted to understand what happened in the former Yugoslavia I ve always felt the responsibility since it was my generation I thought I d use writing this script as an excuse to do research It sat on my desk for a little while until Brad picked it up and read it And he said You know honey this is really not that bad It s kind of good ,Angelina Jolie,The decision to write and direct In the Land of Blood and Honey was motivated by both artistic and advocacy reasons On the artistic side I was drawn to the story of the Bosnian war as a subject for a film because of its complexity intensity and human drama I wanted to explore the ways in which war tears apart communities families and individuals and to show how people can find resilience and hope even in the midst of unimaginable suffering At the same time however I was also motivated by a strong sense of advocacy and a desire to bring attention to the plight of the people affected by the war I wanted to shine a light on the atrocities that were committed and to show the world the human cost of war and conflict Therefore while the film was certainly driven by artistic considerations it was also very much a product of my commitment to using my platform as an artist and public figure to raise awareness of important issues and to advocate for positive change Overall I hope that In the Land of Blood and Honey succeeded in both artistic and advocacy terms and that it helped to draw attention to the experiences of those affected by the Bosnian war while also telling a powerful and compelling story 
At this point in your career what validates your work Is it what critics say ,I never read what critics say I think it s healthy laughs I like the process of making a film when we ve worked really hard in making a good film I feel satisfied I like the team of other actors and the crew the director I just love the family and if we feel we ve done our best I feel happy The best obviously is when an audience responds and enjoys the film and people tell you they ve had a good time or they ve learned something it s the greatest ,Angelina Jolie,I believe that there are many different factors that validate my work as an artist and filmmaker and that critics are just one piece of the puzzle Of course it is always gratifying to receive positive feedback from critics and audiences alike and to know that my work is resonating with people and having an impact At the same time however I also believe that the validation of my work comes from a variety of other sources such as the creative process itself the sense of purpose and meaning that it brings to my life and the feedback and support of my collaborators and colleagues For me the most important thing is to stay true to my own creative vision and to the stories and ideas that inspire me I am always striving to learn and grow as an artist to push the boundaries of what is possible and to tell stories that have meaning and resonance in the world Ultimately I believe that the validation of my work will come from the impact that it has on people s lives whether that be through inspiring and entertaining them raising awareness of important issues or helping to create positive change in the world And while critics and others may have their opinions what truly matters is the connection that I am able to make with audiences and the ways in which my work is able to touch and move people 
Since you did your own stunts what were your days like Were you exhausted ,It seems like so much but it was spread out and I was exhausted But the kids would come and we would have lunch and I was home by the time the sun went down There are much harder jobs ,Angelina Jolie,Doing my own stunts on set was definitely a challenging and physically demanding experience However it was also incredibly exhilarating and fulfilling to be able to push myself to the limits and to bring a sense of realism and authenticity to the action sequences in my films On a typical day on set I would start early in the morning with a rigorous physical warm up to prepare my body for the demands of the day ahead This would often involve stretching cardio and strength training exercises to build stamina and endurance Once we started filming the days were long and intense with many hours spent rehearsing and filming action sequences This could involve running jumping climbing and fighting often in challenging or hazardous environments Despite the physical demands of the work however I found that the adrenaline and excitement of the moment helped to keep me going And while I was certainly tired at the end of each day I also felt a great sense of accomplishment and pride in what I had been able to achieve Overall doing my own stunts was a challenging but ultimately rewarding experience and one that I believe helped to bring an extra level of authenticity and intensity to my performances on screen 
Vanity Fair reported you saying that you d give up acting at some point is that true ,Not that I d give up acting I think I would just do less at some point I have a few more stories that I d like to tell but I can imagine that I ll just do less and less as my kids grow up I d like to do other things before my life is over ,Angelina Jolie,It is true that I have said in the past that I may eventually step away from acting in order to focus more on my work behind the camera and on my humanitarian and advocacy efforts While I have always loved the art and craft of acting I have also found great fulfillment in other aspects of my career such as writing and directing and in my work outside of the entertainment industry As I have grown and evolved as a person and as an artist I have felt a strong pull towards these other areas of my life and I believe that they are where I can have the greatest impact and make the most meaningful contributions However I should note that I have no immediate plans to retire from acting and that I will always be open to new opportunities and experiences in this field Ultimately my focus is on following my passions and doing work that has meaning and purpose whether that be in front of the camera behind it or in other aspects of my life 
Cinematically what things do you feel you haven t done ,Well there s been talk about Cleopatra I haven t done a historical epic of that nature and she s always been fascinating to me I feel that as much as her story has been done so many times it s never been done accurately Not that any movie can get history perfectly right There s no universal truth to history in film but you can get closer and I feel that there s a lot that hasn t been explored about her Theres a lot that would have to come together for that to work ,Angelina Jolie,I believe that there is always more to explore and achieve as a filmmaker and that there are many cinematic challenges and opportunities that I have yet to fully explore One area that I am particularly interested in exploring further is the use of new and innovative storytelling techniques and technologies such as virtual and augmented reality to create immersive and engaging cinematic experiences I believe that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way that we tell stories and to create new opportunities for audience engagement and participation I am also interested in continuing to explore and push the boundaries of genre and to find new and creative ways to tell stories that challenge and subvert audience expectations Whether it is through blending genres playing with narrative structure or experimenting with visual style and design I believe that there are always new and exciting ways to engage and surprise audiences Overall my goal as a filmmaker is to continue to evolve and grow to push the boundaries of what is possible and to create work that is both artistically challenging and emotionally resonant 
How do you think the COVID 19 pandemic has impacted the rights of children worldwide ,The pandemic has absolutely affected children the most Poverty hunger and insecurity have all got worse Children have missed out on school for long periods Some may never go back One example is of a girl I m aware of who fought to have the chance to go to school who was then forced to stay at home because of the pandemic Her parents with no real income decided that she would now have less of a chance at making up her studies and forced her to marry Another area where children have been heavily affected is domestic violence with so many out of school in all countries It s often hard to detect but when kids are in school there is more of a chance of visual signs being reported ,Angelina Jolie,I believe that the COVID 19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the rights of children worldwide and that it has exposed and exacerbated many of the existing inequalities and challenges facing young people today In many parts of the world children have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic with millions of young people experiencing disruptions to their education health care and social services Children from marginalized communities including those living in poverty refugees and internally displaced persons and those with disabilities have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and have often been left without access to the resources and support that they need At the same time the pandemic has also highlighted the critical importance of investing in the rights and well being of children and has spurred many individuals and organizations to take action to protect and support young people in these challenging times Overall I believe that it is essential that we continue to prioritize the rights and needs of children in our response to the pandemic and in our efforts to build a more just and equitable world We must work together to ensure that every child has access to the resources services and support that they need to thrive and to create a future in which all young people have the opportunity to realize their full potential 
What would you say is the most important children s right and why ,For me the right to be heard is so important because if we are able to listen and understand there is a higher chance of youth being respected resulting in better treatment But in actual fact all child rights have equal importance If we start to say one matters above the other then that becomes an excuse for countries to pick and choose ,Angelina Jolie,I believe that all children have the right to a safe and loving home free from violence and abuse This is because a child s home environment lays the foundation for their physical emotional and mental well being and has a profound impact on their ability to grow and thrive When children are exposed to violence neglect or abuse in the home they are at risk of developing a range of physical and mental health problems as well as experiencing long term impacts on their social and emotional development In order for children to reach their full potential it is essential that they have a stable and nurturing home environment where they feel safe loved and supported Of course ensuring that every child has access to a safe and loving home is a complex and multifaceted challenge and requires a range of interventions and support systems This includes everything from providing family support services to investing in early childhood education and development to implementing laws and policies that protect children s rights and ensure that perpetrators of violence are held accountable Overall I believe that creating a world in which every child has the right to a safe and loving home should be a top priority for all of us and that we must work together to build the systems and structures necessary to make this a reality 
As someone who has an extremely successful career in entertainment what first inspired you to pursue a humanitarian career and advocate for children s rights in particular ,When I began to travel and broaden my understanding beyond my schooling I realized all I didn t know I simply saw the world more as it really is and felt compelled to be of use I don t think of it as something good I do but that I am fortunate to be allowed to work with so many resilient and warm people who have taught me about life and family in ways I never knew Life really means nothing if you are only living for yourself ,Angelina Jolie,My interest in humanitarian work and advocacy for children s rights began at a very young age and was inspired by a combination of personal experiences and a deep sense of empathy and compassion for those who are marginalized or suffering Growing up I was exposed to the struggles and injustices faced by many people around the world and saw firsthand the impact that these challenges can have on individuals and communities As I became more aware of the world around me I became increasingly committed to using my platform and resources to make a difference and to support those who are most in need In particular my focus on children s rights was inspired by my experiences as a mother and by my belief that every child deserves to grow up in a safe and loving environment with access to the resources and opportunities necessary to realize their full potential As I became more involved in humanitarian work I saw firsthand the many challenges facing children around the world from poverty and lack of access to education and healthcare to violence and exploitation Ultimately my decision to pursue a humanitarian career and advocate for children s rights was driven by my desire to make a positive difference in the world and to use my platform and resources to help create a more just and equitable society While my work in the entertainment industry has been a vital part of my career and my identity my commitment to humanitarian work and advocacy will always be at the core of who I am and what I do 
What first made you aware of the landmine situation around the world ,When I went to Cambodia for work I was suddenly in a country where I saw it was a very big problem We were restricted to where we could move or walk because of landmines ,Angelina Jolie,My awareness of the landmine situation around the world began when I was filming the 2001 movie Lara Croft Tomb Raider in Cambodia While I was there I became aware of the devastating impact that landmines were having on the local population particularly on children and other vulnerable groups I saw firsthand the toll that landmines were taking on the physical and emotional well being of those affected and became deeply committed to doing whatever I could to help raise awareness of this issue and to support efforts to address it Over the years I have worked closely with a number of organizations and initiatives focused on demining and landmine clearance and have become a leading advocate for the rights of landmine survivors and their families Through my work I have seen the power of collective action and the ability of individuals and communities to come together to make a real difference in the lives of those affected by this devastating problem Ultimately my commitment to addressing the landmine situation around the world is driven by my belief that every person has the right to live in safety and dignity and by my desire to use my platform and resources to help create a more just and equitable world 
What about Cambodia pulled your attention away from the movie and towards Cambodia and its people ,I think it s a lot of things like knowing the history of the place and having not been taught at school I felt I should have been taught about the landmine problem It made me suddenly realise certain things about the world and how much I had to learn like the history of the people They are so warm and great and spirited they are such survivors I think they are such amazing people ,Angelina Jolie,My interest in Cambodia and its people began long before I traveled there to film Lara Croft Tomb Raider I had been aware of the country s history of conflict and violence and of the struggles that its people had faced over the years When I arrived in Cambodia to film the movie I was struck by the resilience and strength of the people I met despite the challenges they had faced I was moved by their warmth and hospitality and by their deep connection to their culture and history Over time my visits to Cambodia and my interactions with its people led me to become more involved in humanitarian work in the country and to establish the Maddox Jolie Pitt Foundation which is dedicated to supporting community based development initiatives in Cambodia and other countries in the region Ultimately my connection to Cambodia and its people is driven by my belief in the power of human connection and compassion and by my desire to use my platform and resources to support those who are most in need Whether through my work in entertainment or my humanitarian efforts my goal is always to help create a more just and equitable world and to support the dignity and well being of all people 
While you were in Cambodia or Pakistan or Africa did you ever personally feel in danger because of landmines or any other issues ,Well landmines specifically would be Cambodia Yeah I went off into certain areas where you were just told that nothing had exploded in this area therefore it s not considered a high risk area but you along with everybody else stay on a very clear path that has already been walked You don t stray from it You know in the middle of the night when I had to go use the bathroom in the bushes and was not really sure where the path was It s crazy the thought that you really don t know and for people to live like that all the time There were times when we would go wandering off in Cambodia and had to be extremely careful where we were going and to know the area For anybody that works in any kind of demining or any kind of humanitarian aid work there is danger and it s always a high risk area ,Angelina Jolie,During my visits to countries affected by landmines or other security concerns I have always taken appropriate precautions to ensure my safety and the safety of those around me This includes working closely with local security teams and being mindful of potential risks and dangers That being said I have certainly been in situations where I have felt the impact of the challenges faced by local communities Whether it is seeing the impact of landmines on the lives of those affected or witnessing the devastating consequences of violence and conflict these experiences have deepened my commitment to addressing the root causes of these problems and to working towards lasting solutions Ultimately my work in humanitarian and development efforts is not about me or my safety but about supporting the dignity and well being of those who are most in need Whether it is through my advocacy efforts or through my work with organizations and initiatives focused on addressing these challenges my goal is always to make a positive difference in the lives of those affected and to help build a more just and equitable world for all 
What do you feel being an Ambassador for UNHCR has done for the organisations ,I hope it has brought more awareness That s all I can hope for I know what it s done for me but I hope it has brought more awareness I feel it has because people tend to ask me questions and I have received a lot of letters from young people talking about the things they are doing to make a difference And that s been a very nice thing because I didn t get letters like that before The most important thing or the thing I think I accomplished most was going to these places and sitting down with the families for about an hour and I think what matters most of all is that you go out of your way to sit down with people and listen to their stories and talk with them and show them somebody cares and is listening ,Angelina Jolie,Serving as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life Through my work with the organization I have had the opportunity to witness firsthand the incredible work being done by UNHCR and its partners to support refugees displaced persons and stateless individuals around the world As an Ambassador I have been able to use my platform and resources to help raise awareness of the urgent need for support and assistance for those affected by conflict persecution and other forms of displacement Through my advocacy efforts I have helped to bring attention to the plight of refugees and to support the work of UNHCR in providing life saving assistance and protection to those who are most in need I believe that my role as an Ambassador has helped to raise the profile of UNHCR and to inspire others to become involved in supporting the organization s important work By highlighting the urgent need for support and by sharing stories of the resilience and strength of refugees and displaced persons I hope to have helped to foster greater understanding and empathy for those affected by these challenges Ultimately my work as an Ambassador is driven by my belief in the power of collective action and my desire to use my platform and resources to make a positive difference in the world I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to serve as an Ambassador for UNHCR and for the chance to work alongside so many dedicated and inspiring individuals who are committed to helping build a more just and equitable world for all 
Do you have any plans for further involvement with other humanitarian programmes or more specifically landmine organisations ,Yes with landmines well the film I just finished deals with a lot of things but it also deals with landmines which has been great a very interesting thing to have the whole crew listening about the effects of landmines But yes I certainly will We were just in Namibia and I am more aware of that area That area is changing and I don t know if we will understand more about the landmine situation there And in Afghanistan I m sure with UNHCR moving back in there will be a lot they will be dealing with and they will be dealing with working hand in hand with deminers And in Cambodia I have funded some schools and I plan to move to Cambodia and have a house there and a place to live So all of that has to be demined The schools have already been demined The land will have to be demined There s also organisations too like the Campaign to Ban Landmines I ve met with Jody Williams and spent some time with her we ve had an evening at the house to raise awareness There s a lot to do Hopefully it will stop all the manufacturing and everybody will sign off because that s what has to happen before anything ,Angelina Jolie,My work in humanitarian and development efforts is an ongoing commitment and I am always looking for ways to support and contribute to these important causes Over the years I have been involved in a range of initiatives focused on addressing the needs of vulnerable communities including efforts to address the impact of landmines support refugees and displaced persons and promote human rights and gender equality Going forward I remain deeply committed to these issues and to using my platform and resources to support those who are most in need Whether it is through my continued work with UNHCR my advocacy efforts on behalf of landmine survivors and their families or my support for other organizations and initiatives focused on addressing pressing humanitarian and development challenges I am always looking for ways to make a positive difference in the world Ultimately my goal is to help build a more just and equitable world and to support the dignity and well being of all people regardless of their circumstances or background I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to contribute to these efforts thus far and look forward to continuing to work towards these important goals in the years to come 
How do you keep yourself from worrying ,Through training how to tackle destructive emotion and how to develop positive emotion This is very important All destructive emotion is based on appearances not reason so we cannot meditate on anger hatred fear But positive emotions such as compassion altruism or enthusiasm are based on reality on reason so we can train them through meditation Ignore seeing ignore hearing pay more attention to your mind Only the human brain has the ability to concentrate on a point and analyze ,Dalai Lama,I believe that worrying and anxiety can be a natural part of the human experience but that we have the ability to cultivate inner peace and tranquility through practices such as meditation and mindfulness One of the key practices that I personally use to manage worrying is mindfulness meditation By staying present in the moment and observing my thoughts and emotions without judgment I am able to cultivate a sense of inner calm and peace even amidst challenging circumstances In addition to meditation I also try to stay focused on cultivating positive emotions such as compassion kindness and gratitude By focusing on these qualities I am able to shift my attention away from worrying and negative thoughts and towards the things that bring me joy and fulfillment Ultimately I believe that the key to managing worrying is to cultivate inner awareness and to develop a deep sense of inner peace and contentment By staying mindful of my thoughts and emotions and by cultivating positive qualities such as compassion and gratitude I am able to stay grounded and centered even in the face of challenging circumstances 
What kind of student were you ,I was quite lazy My tutor sometimes threatened to show whips But gradually my mind my brain grew quite sharp Certain subjects scholars find difficult for me were easy So I believe that in my previous life that subject was familiar ,Dalai Lama,I was a curious and studious child From a young age I was deeply interested in philosophy theology and the nature of existence and I spent much of my childhood studying and learning from the great masters and scholars of Tibetan Buddhism Throughout my education I was known for my intellectual curiosity and my willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and explore new ideas I was a dedicated student and I worked hard to deepen my understanding of the nature of reality and the human experience Despite the challenges and difficulties of my upbringing I remained committed to my studies and my spiritual practice and I worked tirelessly to develop my knowledge and understanding of Buddhist philosophy and practice Over time this dedication and commitment helped to shape my worldview and my approach to life and it has guided me throughout my life s work as a spiritual leader and advocate for peace and compassion 
The album Inner World was released on your 85th birthday Is there something beneficial that your music has been able to do in this time that you have not been able to do ,My main practice is altruism My body voice mind are dedicated to the well being of 7 billion human beings Nice sound comes they feel happy Sound affects the mind Music comes on Their face like ,Dalai Lama,I believe that music has the power to inspire and uplift people in profound ways The release of Inner World on my 85th birthday was a testament to the power of music to bring people together to lift their spirits and to inspire them to live with greater compassion and wisdom While I have spent much of my life working to promote peace compassion and understanding through my teachings and my work as a spiritual leader I believe that music has a unique ability to touch people s hearts and minds in a way that words alone cannot Through the release of Inner World I hope to bring the message of compassion and wisdom to a wider audience and to inspire people to live with greater mindfulness kindness and empathy Whether through music meditation or other means I believe that we all have the ability to cultivate greater peace and compassion in our lives and to help create a more peaceful and just world for all beings 
You ve said that the next Dalai Lama might be female or maybe there shouldn t even be a 15th Dalai Lama What s the future of the institution ,Next Dalai Lama not my business Tibetan people have the right to decide whether the institution should continue or not ,Dalai Lama,I have long believed in the importance of questioning and reexamining traditional institutions and practices in order to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in today s world With regard to the future of the institution of the Dalai Lama I have suggested that it may be time to reconsider the traditional process for selecting a new Dalai Lama and to explore new approaches that reflect the changing needs and realities of our world One possibility that I have suggested is the idea of a female Dalai Lama which would be a historic first for our tradition I believe that this could help to promote greater gender equality and social justice and to inspire people to think more deeply about the role of women in leadership and spirituality At the same time I have also suggested that it may be possible to create a new system of leadership and governance that does not rely on a single centralized authority figure like the Dalai Lama Instead we could work to develop more collaborative and decentralized models of leadership that reflect the interconnected and interdependent nature of our world Ultimately my hope is that we can use this moment of change and uncertainty to reflect deeply on the nature of leadership spirituality and social change and to explore new approaches that can help us to create a more peaceful just and compassionate world for all beings 
If you were to meet Donald Trump is there something you d like to say ,Today my number one commitment is try to promote a sense of oneness of 7 billion human beings I m hoping all the leaders of the world and particularly the big nations leaders America Russia China India see oneness of all 7 billion human beings When he became president he mentioned America First with that I have some reservation America is the leading nation of the free world so morally historically America has responsibility Children at two years they play together They don t care about other child s religion other nationality Then once the children start education there s not much talking about warmheartedness just knowledge and that creates some feeling of we and they and then gradually my nation their nation my religion their religion Our education should include moral teachings Religion No But moral teaching Your own successful life very much depends on warmheartedness ,Dalai Lama,I believe that it is important to approach all people with kindness compassion and an open mind regardless of their political beliefs or personal views If I were to meet with Donald Trump I would begin by offering my sincere wishes for his well being and happiness and by expressing my hope that he would use his position of power and influence to promote greater peace justice and compassion in the world I would also encourage him to consider the importance of humility empathy and kindness in leadership and to think deeply about the impact that his words and actions have on the well being of others Ultimately I believe that our world is in need of leaders who can inspire us to live with greater compassion and wisdom and who can work together to create a more peaceful and just world for all beings Whether through dialogue meditation or other means I would be honored to have the opportunity to engage in a meaningful and constructive conversation with Donald Trump or with any other leader about the importance of cultivating greater peace and compassion in our lives and in our world 
What you call wise selfishness ,Taking care of others is the best way you fulfill your self interest Altruism is very useful very important to keep peace of mind Any person I meet I feel are brothers sisters That brings me inner peace I think I can say Dalai Lama wherever I go always smiles ,Dalai Lama,I have often spoken about the concept of wise selfishness which refers to the idea that we can best serve our own interests by helping others and contributing to the greater good Rather than pursuing our own self interest in a narrow or shortsighted way wise selfishness involves recognizing that our well being is interconnected with the well being of others and that by working together to create a more peaceful just and compassionate world we can all benefit This means that we must cultivate qualities like empathy kindness and generosity and seek to contribute to the well being of others as much as we seek to benefit ourselves By doing so we not only improve our own lives but also create a positive ripple effect that can benefit others and the world as a whole Ultimately wise selfishness is about recognizing that our true happiness and fulfillment come not from accumulating wealth or power but from living with greater mindfulness compassion and wisdom and from working together to create a more peaceful and just world for all beings 
Do you ever feel angry or outraged ,Oh yes of course I m a human being Generally speaking if a human being never shows anger then I think something s wrong He s not right in the brain ,Dalai Lama,I believe that it is natural for human beings to experience a range of emotions including anger and outrage However I also believe that it is important to cultivate mindfulness and awareness in order to respond to these emotions in a constructive way Rather than allowing anger or outrage to cloud our judgment and lead us to negative actions we can use mindfulness and awareness to recognize these emotions when they arise and to respond with greater compassion understanding and wisdom For example if we feel angry or outraged about a social injustice or a situation of conflict we can use these emotions as a motivator to take positive action such as advocating for change or working to promote greater understanding and reconciliation Ultimately I believe that the key to responding to anger and outrage in a positive way is to cultivate greater awareness and mindfulness and to approach all situations with a deep sense of compassion wisdom and understanding 
How do you stay so optimistic and faithful when there is so much hate in the world ,I always look at any event from a wider angle There s always some problem some killing some murder or terrorist act or scandal everywhere every day But if you think the whole world is like that you re wrong Out of 6 billion humans the troublemakers are just a handful ,Dalai Lama,I believe that it is important to cultivate a positive outlook on life even in the face of adversity and hatred While it can be easy to become discouraged by the negative actions and attitudes of others I believe that it is possible to maintain a sense of hope and optimism by focusing on our shared humanity and the potential for positive change One of the key ways that I stay optimistic is by cultivating a sense of inner peace and calm through practices like meditation and mindfulness By turning inward and cultivating a sense of inner harmony we can develop a more positive and compassionate outlook on the world around us In addition I believe that it is important to focus on positive actions and to seek out examples of compassion and kindness in the world By celebrating the good deeds of others and working to promote positive change ourselves we can help to counteract the negativity and hatred that can sometimes feel overwhelming Ultimately I believe that the key to staying optimistic and faithful in the face of hate is to cultivate a deep sense of compassion wisdom and understanding and to approach all situations with a sense of hope and positivity By doing so we can work together to create a more peaceful and harmonious world for all beings 
How has the role set out for you changed since you first came to be the Dalai Lama ,I became the Dalai Lama not on a volunteer basis Whether I was willing or not I had to study Buddhist philosophy like an ordinary monk student in these big monastic institutions Eventually I realized I have a responsibility Sometimes it is difficult but where there is some challenge that is also truly an opportunity to serve more ,Dalai Lama,I believe that my role has evolved over time in response to changing global circumstances and the needs of the Tibetan people When I first became the Dalai Lama my primary role was to serve as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and to guide them in their practice of Buddhism and their pursuit of peace and harmony However over time I have come to see that my role extends beyond the borders of Tibet and that I have a responsibility to promote greater understanding and compassion throughout the world I have worked to use my position to promote dialogue and reconciliation between different cultures and faiths and to advocate for greater respect for human rights and the environment At the same time I have also had to navigate the challenges and complexities of living in exile and to work to maintain the unity and cohesion of the Tibetan people despite the difficult circumstances we face Throughout my time as the Dalai Lama I have sought to adapt to changing circumstances and to respond to the needs of the people I serve while remaining true to the principles of compassion wisdom and understanding that guide my work 
Do you see any possibility of reconciliation with the Chinese government in your lifetime ,Yes there is a possibility But I think past experience shows it is not easy Many of these hard liners their outlook is very narrow and shortsighted They are not looking at it in a holistic way However within the People s Republic of China there is wider contact with the outside world There are more and more voices of discontentment among the people particularly among the intellectuals Things will change that s bound to happen ,Dalai Lama,I believe that the path to reconciliation with the Chinese government is a difficult one but it is also an essential one Despite the many challenges and obstacles that we face I remain hopeful that it is possible to find a way forward that is respectful of both the rights of the Tibetan people and the interests of the Chinese government In recent years we have seen some positive developments including greater openness to dialogue and greater international attention to the situation in Tibet However much work remains to be done and I believe that it will require the sustained efforts of many individuals and organizations to achieve a lasting resolution to the conflict Ultimately I believe that the key to reconciliation is through dialogue and mutual respect and by working together to find a solution that benefits all parties involved While it may take time I remain hopeful that we can find a way forward that is just and sustainable for all 
How can we teach our children not to be angry ,Children always look to their parents Parents should be more calm You can teach children that you face a lot of problems but you must react to those problems with a calm mind and reason I have always had this view about the modern education system we pay attention to brain development but the development of warmheartedness we take for granted ,Dalai Lama,I believe that it is important to teach our children to understand the root causes of anger and to develop the skills and habits of mind that can help them manage and transform their anger in healthy and productive ways One important step is to help children learn to recognize the signs of anger and to understand that it is a natural emotion that everyone experiences from time to time By teaching children to observe their own emotions without judgment we can help them develop greater self awareness and the ability to regulate their emotions Another important strategy is to teach children the value of empathy and compassion and to help them develop the habit of seeing things from others perspectives By encouraging children to imagine themselves in someone else s shoes we can help them develop a deeper understanding of the causes of conflict and the importance of kindness and understanding in resolving disagreements Finally it is important to teach children the skills of effective communication and conflict resolution so that they have the tools they need to express themselves in healthy and constructive ways and to work towards peaceful solutions to conflicts Ultimately by teaching children these skills and values from a young age we can help them develop the emotional intelligence and social skills they need to lead happy fulfilling and compassionate lives 
Have you ever thought about being a normal person instead of being the Dalai Lama ,Yes at a young age Sometimes I felt Oh this is a burden I wish I was an unknown Tibetan Then I d have more freedom But then later I realized that my position was something useful to others Nowadays I feel happy that I m Dalai Lama At the same time I never feel that I m some special person Same we are all the same ,Dalai Lama,I believe that every person has their own unique path in life and that it is important to cultivate a sense of purpose and meaning in whatever role we find ourselves in While there may be times when I have wondered what my life might have been like if I had not been born into the role of the Dalai Lama I have always tried to embrace my responsibilities and use my position to help promote peace compassion and understanding in the world At the same time I also recognize the importance of leading a balanced and healthy life and have always tried to make time for my own spiritual practice as well as for my family and loved ones Ultimately I believe that it is possible for all of us to find a sense of purpose and meaning in life whether we are leaders parents teachers or simply ordinary individuals trying to make a positive difference in the world It is up to each of us to find our own path and to embrace the challenges and opportunities that come our way with a sense of openness curiosity and compassion 
Do you miss Tibet ,Yes Tibetan culture is not only ancient but relevant to today s world After seeing the problems of violence we realize that Tibetan culture is one of compassion and nonviolence There is also the climate In India during monsoon season it is too wet Then I very much miss Tibet ,Dalai Lama,I carry the spirit of Tibet with me wherever I go While I have been in exile from my homeland for many years now I have always remained connected to the Tibetan people and culture and have continued to work tirelessly to promote the cause of Tibetan freedom and human rights Of course I do miss the physical beauty of Tibet with its majestic mountains sweeping landscapes and vibrant cultural traditions But at the same time I also recognize that the true essence of Tibet is not contained within its borders or its material possessions but rather in the hearts and minds of its people As such my focus remains on promoting the values of compassion nonviolence and human dignity that are at the heart of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and on working towards a peaceful and just resolution of the Tibetan issue both for the sake of the Tibetan people and for the wider global community 
What do you say to people who use religion as a pretext to violence or killing ,There are innocent faithful people that are manipulated by some other people whose interest is different Their interest is not religion but power or sometimes money They manipulate religious faith In such cases we must make a distinction these bad things are not caused by religion ,Dalai Lama,As someone who is deeply committed to the values of compassion nonviolence and interfaith harmony I find it deeply troubling when religion is used as a justification for violence and killing In my view such actions are a perversion of the true teachings of all the great religious traditions which emphasize the importance of kindness empathy and respect for all beings Moreover they go against the fundamental principles of human dignity and human rights that are enshrined in international law and in the hearts and minds of people of goodwill around the world To those who would use religion as a pretext for violence or killing I would urge them to reflect deeply on the true teachings of their faith and to seek out the guidance of wise and compassionate spiritual leaders who can help them to better understand and embody these teachings in their daily lives And I would also call on all people of faith to come together in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation to work towards a world in which the principles of compassion nonviolence and respect for all are truly honored and upheld 
Have you ever tried on a pair of trousers ,When it s very very cold And particularly in 1959 when I escaped I wore trousers like laypeople dressed So I have experience ,Dalai Lama,My focus has always been on matters of the mind and spirit rather than on mundane matters such as clothing That being said as a human being I have certainly worn trousers on occasion especially during my travels to colder climates However I do not place much importance on such matters of personal appearance as my focus remains on promoting peace compassion and human values throughout the world 
Do you believe your time here on earth has been a success ,Hmmm That s relative It s so difficult to say All human life is some part failure and some part achievement ,Dalai Lama,As a spiritual leader I do not measure success in the same way that a businessperson or politician might Instead my focus has been on promoting compassion peace and human values throughout the world While there is always more work to be done in this regard I am pleased with the progress that has been made and the positive impact that my teachings have had on countless individuals and communities Ultimately I believe that success is measured not by personal accomplishments but by the positive impact that we have on others and the world around us 
Here s a question you probably hear all the time read any good books lately ,I read a book recently about Toyota s lean production methodology which is very interesting I m reading a new Alastair Reynolds science fiction book about Earth being destroyed by nanobots And I ve been reading about rocket engine development ,Jeff Bezos,I m always reading something new and I m a big fan of books that explore new ideas and ways of thinking One book that I ve recently read and found particularly insightful is The End of Power by Moisés Naím It s a fascinating exploration of how traditional forms of power are changing in the modern world and how individuals and organizations are adapting to this new landscape I also recently read The Innovators by Walter Isaacson which tells the story of the people and ideas that have shaped the digital age Both books have provided me with valuable insights and perspectives that have helped to inform my work at Amazon and beyond 
Amazon s stock price has fallen 17 over the past 12 months will there be boom times again ,We went public at a split adjusted price of 1 50 a share and it s gone to 38 a share in eight years which is unusual performance by any measure We focus on things that matter to customers not the stock price which takes care of itself The business results generated by the company This is by far our best year ever ,Jeff Bezos,As a long term investor I always try to focus on the big picture and the long term potential of our company rather than short term fluctuations in the stock price Amazon has always been focused on innovation customer obsession and long term growth and we have a track record of investing heavily in new initiatives and ideas that have ultimately paid off for our customers our employees and our shareholders Of course no company or industry is immune to ups and downs and the past year has been particularly challenging for everyone due to the global pandemic But I m confident that as we continue to focus on serving our customers investing in new technologies and ideas and staying true to our core values we will continue to see strong growth and success in the years to come So I m optimistic about the future of Amazon and our ability to create value for all of our stakeholders

Should the government step in to legislate against spyware and companies that lose personal data ,I don t know Even things that are most annoying today like viruses and spam a lot of it is already illegal Unfortunately there are a small number of bad actors who do these things The companies that create the operating systems have to play this cat and mouse game ,Jeff Bezos,As a company Amazon is committed to protecting customer privacy and security We believe that all companies have a responsibility to protect personal data and prevent the spread of spyware While government regulation may have a role in addressing these issues it is important to strike a balance between protecting privacy and ensuring innovation and growth in the tech industry As such we support efforts to create clear and transparent standards for data protection and cybersecurity while also promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in the tech sector

You have been showing short movies on amazon What s the long term plan for amazon and video delivery ,Over time it may be possible to do high quality video delivery over the Internet It s something we ve thought about for years but most people don t have the kind of bandwidth they d need to get full length motion pictures delivered ,Jeff Bezos,As you may know Amazon has been investing heavily in its Prime Video platform and we see a lot of potential there We believe that high quality video content is one of the key ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and offer more value to our customers We are always looking for new ways to improve our video offerings and to make it easier for customers to access and enjoy this content So in the long term we see video delivery as a critical part of our business strategy

What do you think will be amazon s biggest gift item this holiday season ,One of our top gift items is the Philips HeartStart defibrillator Defibrillators will continue to get cheaper and end up as a very common piece of household equipment much like a fire extinguisher ,Jeff Bezos,As the CEO of Amazon I believe that we offer a wide variety of gift options for our customers during the holiday season and it s hard to predict what will be the biggest seller We strive to offer our customers a diverse selection of products to choose from including popular electronics home goods and fashion items among others However I would like to emphasize that we are always working to improve the customer experience and offer the best possible selection of products at competitive prices

Do you embrace the African American experience Do you feel a responsibility to lift up others ,That s a weird question I am African American so whatever experience I am going through is the African American experience If I decided to go to Antarctica and raise polar bears it s still the African American experience Should I lift people up Everyone black or white should feel a responsibility to help others ,Chris Rock,As a comedian and public figure I believe it s important to speak to the experiences and issues facing African Americans and to use my platform to amplify their voices I also think it s important to address the systemic racism and inequality that exists in our society and to work towards creating a more just and equitable world As for lifting up others I believe in using my success and influence to support and mentor aspiring comedians and creatives regardless of their race or background 
What do you think of the relationship of African Americans with Africa and Africans ,This is Time magazine I might not be smart enough to be in Time magazine African Americans and Africa That it is a hard relationship Africa is so far away so people don t really get a chance to visit it You add in the poverty that African Americans my people suffer in America and it makes it really hard to think about another country I ve been a couple of times but you know it costs a lot of money to go to Africa It just shows you how bad slavery was even if you take out the fact that my people were beaten raped and all our religion and culture was stripped from us Just the boat trip alone is one of the worst things that have ever been done to human beings ,Chris Rock,As a comedian my focus is on entertaining people and making them laugh but I do have some thoughts on the relationship of African Americans with Africa and Africans I think there s a lot of history and cultural connections there that can be explored and celebrated At the same time I also think it s important to recognize and address the issues that exist between different communities both within the African diaspora and between Africans and African Americans Ultimately I believe in the power of communication and understanding to bridge divides and create a more united global community 
What do you think of illegal immigration Do you think it hurts other minorities or is it just an overblown plot by the Man to foster black on brown hate ,It s America you know People should be allowed to come in I guess they should register at some point I see it as white people finding a loophole in the slavery laws ,Chris Rock,I think illegal immigration is a complex issue with many different factors to consider While it s understandable that people want to come to the United States for better opportunities we also need to make sure that our borders are secure and that the people who are here are following the proper legal channels I don t believe it s helpful to pit different minorities against each other or to blame one group for the problems of another We need to approach the issue with compassion and a desire to find a solution that works for everyone 
Why is your comedy so political while your movies are so mainstream ,I don t think my comedy is that political It s more social But whatever When you make comedy and you do stand up you work alone Movies have to go under so much scrutiny A stand up special is a vision and a movie is a consensus in a lot of ways ,Chris Rock,Well for me comedy is a form of social commentary I like to explore the issues that are affecting our society and bring them to light through humor That s why my comedy tends to be more political As for my movies I see them as a way to reach a wider audience and entertain them While there may be some social commentary in my films my primary goal is to make people laugh and have a good time Ultimately I believe that both comedy and movies can be a powerful tool for social change and can help us all to better understand the world around us 
That number is there though You have purportedly the highest of any American 160 confirmed sniper kills What does that mean ,When you take a shot and the guy goes down you have to have witnesses verify that he is dead We d fill out an assessment of what happened the time the place the caliber used the distance what he was doing what he was wearing ,Chris Kyle,As a sniper in the military my job was to protect American soldiers and innocent civilians When I was deployed to Iraq I was given a mission to eliminate enemy combatants who posed a threat to our troops and the Iraqi people My confirmed kills are simply a record of the number of enemy combatants that I successfully eliminated Each one represented a potential threat to the safety and security of American and Iraqi lives It was a difficult and necessary part of my job but I do not take any pride in the number of kills I had 
What goes through your mind when you kill someone ,The first time you re not even sure you can do it But I m not over there looking at these people as people I m not wondering if he has a family I m just trying to keep my guys safe Every time I kill someone he can t plant an IED You don t think twice about it ,Chris Kyle,I think it s important to clarify that killing someone even in a military context is not something that brings joy or satisfaction It s a difficult and complex experience that often leads to a lot of internal struggle and reflection In the moment my focus was always on completing the mission and protecting my fellow soldiers But afterwards it was always a sobering experience to think about the impact my actions had on the people I was fighting against and their families I have a lot of respect for the sacrifices made by everyone involved in war and it s not something that should be taken lightly 
You shot a woman with a toddler in Nasiriyah because she had a grenade But you didn t kill a child in Sadr City who had an RPG launcher What was your line in the sand ,According to the rules of engagement at the time you could kill anyone with an RPG on sight That day I just couldn t kill the kid He ll probably grow up and fight us but I just didn t want to do it ,Chris Kyle,I never wanted to kill anyone But my job as a sniper was to protect my fellow soldiers and complete our mission In the situation you mentioned I made the decision to fire on the woman because I believed she posed an imminent threat to my fellow soldiers In the case of the child in Sadr City I had a clear view of him and could see that he did not pose an immediate threat Every situation is different and as a sniper I had to make difficult judgment calls in a split second 
Some snipers leave a target alive so they can shoot the people who come to his aid Do you think this is O K ,I think so I ve never done it You don t have to leave them alive for someone to come help them With the Muslim faith they need to be buried before either the sun goes down or the sun comes up So they ll come get the body ,Chris Kyle,As a sniper my job was to protect my fellow soldiers and take out threats to their safety I never intentionally targeted innocent civilians or people who were not a direct threat to us In situations where I had to make split second decisions I relied on my training and instincts to determine the best course of action to ensure the safety of my fellow soldiers As for leaving a target alive to shoot those who come to his aid I personally would not do that as it goes against my own moral code and the rules of engagement set by the military 
Does your wife still have to say your name if she gets into bed after you re asleep so you don t come up swinging ,It s not as bad as it used to be But even before I was in the military I was extremely jumpy when asleep ,Chris Kyle,I think it s important to remember that my experiences as a veteran and sniper were unique and not something that everyone can relate to That being said I understand that my training and experiences may have had an impact on my behavior and it s something that my wife and I have had to work through We ve had to find ways to communicate and understand each other s needs and I m grateful that we ve been able to overcome those challenges together It s important for anyone in a relationship to have open and honest communication and to be willing to work through any issues that may arise 
How would you respond to the suggestion that your book makes you seem violent and bloodthirsty ,I really don t care what people think of me I ve got my family I ve got my friends Yes I have been trained to be a little more aggressive if I need to be but I don t go around thumping people ,Chris Kyle,As a veteran and sniper I understand that some people may have that perception but I hope that they also see the larger message of my book which is about the sacrifices and challenges that come with serving one s country My experiences were not always easy or glamorous but I believe it s important to share them to give people a better understanding of the realities of war and the bravery of those who serve My book also sheds light on the struggles and mental health issues that many veterans face when returning home Ultimately my hope is that my story can inspire others to have a deeper appreciation for our military and the sacrifices they make 
Why weren t you a fan of having journalists embedded with the military ,The media cause more problems than they do good For the most part the public is very soft You live in a dreamworld You have no idea what goes on on the other side of the world the harsh realities of what these people are doing to themselves and our guys and there are certain things that need to be done to take care of them ,Chris Kyle,As a sniper I believe that having journalists embedded with the military can compromise operational security and put soldiers at risk Journalists may unintentionally reveal important information or locations that could be used by the enemy to plan attacks Additionally the presence of journalists can distract soldiers from their mission and potentially cause them to take unnecessary risks in order to get good footage or quotes I understand the importance of transparency and keeping the public informed but the safety of our troops must always come first 
Conservatively the war has cost 824 billion and 4 484 Americans and 200 000 Iraqis lives Was it worth it ,I think it was I m not trying to devalue the lives of the guys we lost But going over there we did the right thing ,Chris Kyle,As a veteran and a patriot I believe that the ultimate decision on whether the war was worth it should be left to the families of the fallen soldiers and the Iraqi people The war was not without its costs but the removal of a brutal dictator and the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq are certainly significant accomplishments Ultimately time will tell whether the sacrifices made were worth it but we cannot forget the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought and died in service to their country 
What if killing turns out to be the thing you were best at ,I know that s not true I m a better husband and father than I was a killer I m pretty comfortable with not having to kill anyone Now don t take deer hunting away from me ,Chris Kyle,As a sniper and a veteran I did what I had to do to protect my fellow soldiers and complete our missions While killing is a part of war it is not something to be celebrated or glorified I believe in the importance of peace and hope that one day there will be no need for anyone to take up arms and kill If killing turns out to be the thing I was best at then I hope that my legacy will be one of a man who did what he had to do to protect his country and fellow soldiers but also recognized the importance of peace and reconciliation 
Did you ever imagine that Hello Kitty would be big worldwide ,No not at all When I started I didn t even know whether she would sell in Japan I was told that Hello Kitty was only for children and that Westerners wouldn t carry her around ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Hello Kitty s popularity worldwide has exceeded my wildest dreams When I first started designing Hello Kitty I had no idea that she would become such a global icon It s incredible to see how people from all over the world have embraced her and made her a part of their lives I m very grateful for the love and support that Hello Kitty has received and I m constantly inspired to keep creating new designs and products that will continue to capture people s hearts 
Why doesn t Hello Kitty have a mouth ,It s so that people who look at her can project their own feelings onto her face because she has an expressionless face Kitty looks happy when people are happy She looks sad when they are sad For this psychological reason we thought she shouldn t be tied to any emotion and that s why she doesn t have a mouth ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Hello Kitty was designed to be a character that could express various emotions without needing a mouth This was a deliberate decision made by Sanrio the company that created Hello Kitty to allow people to project their own emotions and feelings onto the character Additionally the lack of a mouth adds to the simplicity and charm of the character s design 
Why is Hello Kitty from London and not somewhere in Japan ,When Hello Kitty was created many girls in Japan had read Alice in Wonderland and adored Britain Also there were other characters created by my company Sanrio who were supposed to have been born and raised in the U S so Kitty was born in London as a way of differentiating her ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Hello Kitty was originally designed by Sanrio a Japanese company in 1974 While Hello Kitty does not have a specific backstory or place of origin in her official character profile her British inspired design elements were added as a way to broaden her appeal and appeal to international audiences Additionally the idea of British culture and fashion was popular in Japan at the time which influenced the design of Hello Kitty s clothing and accessories So Hello Kitty is essentially a fusion of Japanese and British culture 
How do you continue to be fresh without losing the essence of Hello Kitty ,Trends are the key what colors and what motifs are in If roses are in fashion then I think of rose designs I have to be able to predict more or less what is coming ,Yuko Yamaguchi,As the designer of Hello Kitty I always strive to maintain the original essence and spirit of the character while also adapting to new trends and styles It s important to stay up to date with what s happening in the world and understand what people are looking for without compromising the core values and qualities that have made Hello Kitty so beloved over the years Additionally I work closely with a talented team of designers and artists who help to bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the table while also respecting the heritage and legacy of Hello Kitty 
Why do so many adults love Hello Kitty ,People around the world often say that when they were children they couldn t afford Hello Kitty so they started to buy her when they earned money as adults It s not that they all of a sudden discovered Kitty ,Yuko Yamaguchi,As the designer of Hello Kitty I believe the character s appeal comes from its simplicity and universal themes Hello Kitty is relatable to people of all ages because she represents kindness friendship and happiness Also the character s cute and iconic design has become a part of popular culture making it recognizable and beloved by many Additionally Hello Kitty has a nostalgic quality bringing back memories of childhood and simpler times for many adults 
Do you consider a global audience when you re designing ,In the past I was designing only for Japanese fans But lately I ve been designing for Kitty fans in general I don t think so much about where they come from as how delighted they ll be if I do such and such a design ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I always keep in mind the universal appeal of the character while creating new designs I understand that Hello Kitty has a global audience and I strive to create designs that are relatable and appealing to people of all cultures and backgrounds While staying true to the essence of the character I try to incorporate elements that are popular and trendy across different regions of the world 
What s your favorite of all the designs you ve done ,The 1994 1996 Face series which generated a real Kitty boom Until then Kitty was designed for children and I carried around Hello Kitty merchandise only as samples because I was the designer But I actually bought up to 20 pieces from the Face range five for myself and the rest for my friends because I knew that from then on nobody would be telling me that Hello Kitty was just for kids ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I have a special connection to all of the designs I ve created It s hard to pick just one favorite as each design holds a special place in my heart However if I had to choose I would say that the original Hello Kitty design will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first and has become such an iconic symbol around the world 
Is there an item that we will never see Hello Kitty on ,Knives The knife killing rampage in Tokyo in June made me feel even more certain that we are right about not producing knives ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I am always open to exploring new ideas and collaborations However there may be certain products or industries that Hello Kitty may not be suitable for either due to their nature or company policies Ultimately it depends on the specific circumstances and discussions with the brand partners 
What will Hello Kitty be doing in 10 years ,In 10 years time everybody around the world will know her Also the number of male and female fans will be the same Men who are still reluctant to be seen with Kitty in public today might be wearing Hello Kitty boxers But they will eventually stop being shy and will show off Kitty proudly ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I am always looking for new ways to keep the character relevant and fresh while staying true to her essence In 10 years I envision Hello Kitty continuing to bring joy and happiness to people of all ages and cultures through new and exciting collaborations products and experiences I also hope that she will continue to inspire kindness and positivity in the world Ultimately the future of Hello Kitty is in the hands of her fans and I am excited to see how they will continue to embrace and evolve the character in the years to come 
What advice would you give to young artists ,Be interested in different things and see and listen to everything A person who does not have multiple interests is only drawing not designing They become somebody who just draws and gets stuck To design you need to be open to all kinds of information and ideas ,Yuko Yamaguchi,As an artist myself my advice would be to never stop exploring and experimenting with different styles and techniques Keep an open mind and embrace new challenges as they can often lead to breakthroughs and growth in your craft And most importantly never give up on your passion and stay true to your unique creative vision 
What inspired you to work with Hello Kitty ,Hello Kitty debuted in March 1975 From about 1978 she stopped selling well the second designer left and just when I thought that the company would not be looking for a third one the president said that Hello Kitty came to an existence as a symbol of friendship and therefore he could not allow her demise I won the company s competition and became the third designer in January 1980 ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I was inspired by the simplicity and cuteness of cats I wanted to create a character that would embody these qualities and be appealing to both children and adults I also wanted to create a character that would represent Japanese culture and be a positive influence on people s lives Hello Kitty has become a global phenomenon and I am grateful for the opportunity to have created such a beloved character 
When did Hello Kitty spread across the globe ,Nobody knew her in 1984 in the U S where I spent a year designing and people referred to Kitty just as a cat In Japan it was in 1997 that the celebrities began to talk about her as being a cute character thus generating a boom The same phenomenon occurred in the U S and later from around 2002 in Europe ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Hello Kitty started to become popular in the United States in the 1970s and gradually began to spread to other countries eventually becoming a global phenomenon The exact timeline of its global spread may vary depending on the region but it is safe to say that Hello Kitty has been popular worldwide for several decades now 
What brought it from a simple character to the global icon it is today ,I used to be told that Americans would never wear black However I think that the Americans have changed since Anna Sui featured black in her debut collection in NYC and received the plaudits for it Anna Sui loves Hello Kitty and we have a similar taste So I thought that if she were accepted in the U S so would be Kitty Later coincidentally Hello Kitty black handbags rather than purple and pink started to sell well in the States ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Hello Kitty s popularity grew rapidly in the 1990s thanks to the rise of the Japanese kawaii cute culture and the expansion of Sanrio s licensing and merchandising efforts Hello Kitty s appeal also lies in its simplicity innocence and universality which allows people of all ages genders and cultures to connect with the character The brand has also been able to adapt and stay relevant by collaborating with other popular brands and artists and introducing new products and designs that resonate with consumers 
What drives you to create and design ,I try to see everything I look at what fashion houses do read magazines record films and TV programs see everything with high ratings with my own eyes In short everything Also I am an ardent collector It is a pretty scary hobby The amount of money I spend on it can get out of hand My recent favorites are vintage Blythe dolls and I have about 200 ,Yuko Yamaguchi,As a creative person I am driven by my passion for art and design I find inspiration in many things such as nature fashion and even other artists works For me there is nothing more fulfilling than bringing my ideas to life and seeing people enjoy my designs I also believe that design can have a positive impact on people s lives and that motivates me to keep pushing myself to create new and innovative designs 
As an artist and designer has there been any point in your career that you ve wanted to try something new ,I am doing what I want to do I am not only drawing but constantly wondering what would please fans most and whether I can do something new When I did the Kabuki series I saw a lot of Kabuki plays I had a dresser to show me the costumes and they are so heavy that I nearly tripped I don t draw from an imagination so I have to study ,Yuko Yamaguchi,Absolutely I believe that as an artist and designer it s important to constantly challenge yourself and explore new ideas and styles In fact I ve recently started exploring more abstract and minimalistic designs which is quite different from the cute and colorful Hello Kitty style that I m known for It s been a refreshing and exciting experience for me and I m looking forward to seeing where it takes me in the future 
How do you feel about the Hello Kitty imitations ,Personally I don t mind that much but I am always wondering why they are doing it when everybody else can see that they are fakes and fans are not going to buy them Kitty looks simple but she is not She is very hard to imitate and I am sure that fans can spot it immediately ,Yuko Yamaguchi,As the original designer of Hello Kitty I believe that imitations are inevitable in today s global market However as long as they do not infringe on our intellectual property rights we do not see them as a threat In fact it s a testament to the popularity and influence of Hello Kitty that others are inspired to create their own versions Our focus remains on producing high quality original designs that our fans love and cherish 
Hello Kitty has been with her companion Dear Daniel for quite some time now What does their future hold ,About 15 years ago Japanese entertainers began to admit to their boyfriends and girlfriends while before that it was a taboo because they were afraid of losing popularity I didn t want to miss out on that so we admitted that Daniel was her boyfriend I don t know myself what I want to do with their future laughs I am open to any suggestion If everybody wants the two of them to have a baby then they will have a baby ,Yuko Yamaguchi,I always try to stay true to her essence and maintain her popularity with fans around the world As for Dear Daniel he has been a popular character and companion to Hello Kitty for many years and I believe their relationship will continue to evolve and grow in the future As a designer I always try to keep up with the changing trends and interests of the audience and hope to continue to create characters that are loved by people of all ages 
Is there any message that you would like to bring forth through Hello Kitty ,That through Kitty which is a symbol of friendship we can all be friends I want her to be a character that encourages people to become friends Not rivals but friends whose starting point for friendship is Hello Kitty I want her to be a link between all people around the world ,Yuko Yamaguchi,My main goal has always been to bring happiness and joy to people s lives through the character While Hello Kitty does not necessarily have a specific message I hope that her innocent and adorable appearance can bring comfort and positivity to people of all ages and backgrounds My hope is that Hello Kitty can be a source of happiness and a reminder to always embrace the childlike wonder and innocence within us 
Do you really think the electric car can replace the combustion engine ,Absolutely I really do think we re headed toward a future that is 100 electric Within 20 years the majority of new cars manufactured will be pure electric It ll take another 10 or 15 years beyond that for the fleet of existing cars to be primarily electric because it takes a while to switch out things ,Elon Musk,Yes I believe that electric cars can eventually replace combustion engine cars The trend towards electric cars is already underway with more and more people recognizing the benefits of electric vehicles such as lower emissions and lower operating costs As battery technology improves and charging infrastructure becomes more widespread the practicality and convenience of electric cars will only continue to improve Ultimately I believe that electric cars will become the dominant form of transportation in the coming decades 
What is Tesla s greatest challenge in terms of convincing consumers that an electric car is the best option ,At this point we don t have a lot of difficulty doing that In the beginning people didn t know what to expect How do you charge it Is it safe But these are not huge questions anymore These days since we re only selling a roadster our problem is convincing people to pay 100 000 for a car ,Elon Musk,I think the biggest challenge is the misconceptions about electric cars Some people think they don t have enough range they re too expensive or they take too long to charge But the reality is that electric cars have come a long way in terms of range affordability and charging infrastructure We just need to continue educating consumers about the benefits of electric cars and how they can fit into their daily lives As more people adopt electric cars and the technology continues to improve I believe we ll see a shift away from combustion engines towards electric vehicles 
How come you re so damn smart ,These are great questions A lot of times I get asked How come you re so damn stupid I think it s got to be some combination of nature and nurture Having a father who s an engineer is definitely part of it ,Elon Musk,Well I don t really think of myself as particularly smart I think everyone has their own unique abilities and strengths and I ve been fortunate enough to have a curiosity and passion for certain areas that have allowed me to make some breakthroughs But I also recognize that it takes a lot of hard work dedication and collaboration with other talented people to turn those breakthroughs into real world solutions So it s not just about intelligence but also about perseverance teamwork and a willingness to take risks and learn from failures 
Were you considered a geek in school ,When I was a kid I would just walk around reading books all the time And I was also the youngest kid in my grade so I was quite small I was kind of a smart aleck It was a recipe for disaster I d get called every name in the book and beaten up That was my schooling experience ,Elon Musk,Yes I was definitely considered a geek in school I was always interested in science and technology and I spent a lot of time reading books and tinkering with computers I didn t fit in with the popular crowd but I was happy doing my own thing and pursuing my interests 
Did you ever doubt that you were going to succeed in your high risk enterprises ,Absolutely I always knew that there was a chance of failure in all my endeavors But I felt that they were important enough that I had to try even if I thought the probability of success was less than 50 ,Elon Musk,There have been times when I faced significant challenges setbacks and doubts but I never allowed myself to doubt the ultimate goal of what I was trying to achieve I believe that if you are passionate and committed to your vision and willing to put in the hard work and take risks you can overcome any obstacle and achieve your goals I have always been driven by a desire to make a positive impact on the world and to push the boundaries of what is possible and that has kept me motivated even during the toughest times 
Is there a technological limit to what you are capable of creating ,As long as it doesn t violate some law of physics or economics I guess there s ostensibly no limit One thing I know I could get right though it sounds mundane is to apply aerospace engineering techniques to create a double decker freeway with prefabricated high strength metal sections that are dropped into place to double up the lanes so you don t have traffic I ve had plenty of time to contemplate it on L A freeways ,Elon Musk,There is always a limit to what any one person or company can achieve However I believe that by constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible and investing in research and development we can continue to make incredible advancements in technology Ultimately the limit is only our imagination and our ability to work together to achieve our goals 
Do you even come back to South Africa anymore ,I was born and raised in South Africa But my brother and sister are in the U S and most of my cousins are in the U S Most of my family is here I was hoping to go back to South Africa for the World Cup but when I had the Tesla IPO I couldn t go ,Elon Musk,Well I don t visit South Africa very often but I still have fond memories of my childhood there I left when I was 17 to avoid mandatory military service and pursue my education but I still have family and friends there I am proud to be South African and I think the country has a lot of potential for growth and innovation 
What advice would you give to young people in developing countries who want to be entrepreneurs ,Just go and do it Try to get together a group of people to do something useful This may seem like an obvious thing but often people will organize into a company that doesn t produce anything useful ,Elon Musk,As someone who grew up in a developing country myself I would advise young people to not be deterred by the challenges they may face in starting a business In fact I would argue that those challenges can be seen as opportunities for innovation and growth It s important to have a clear vision for what you want to achieve and to stay focused on that goal even when facing setbacks It s also crucial to surround yourself with a team of talented and motivated individuals who share your vision and can help you bring it to life And finally be prepared to work hard and take risks but also be willing to learn from failure and adapt your approach as needed 
SpaceX was founded with the goal of making humanity a space civilization Are you hoping to see that ,If I live for another 40 years then yes The technological breakthrough that s necessary for that would be a truly reusable rocket system That s so critical to lowering the cost of transport to the point where most people could go to space ,Elon Musk,Yes that s the ultimate goal of SpaceX to make humanity a space civilization I believe that it s important for our survival and progress as a species to become a multi planetary civilization This will enable us to ensure the long term survival of the human race and advance our understanding of the universe Through SpaceX s efforts we hope to achieve this goal by making space travel more accessible and affordable for everyone 
What s it like to work with NASA on a rocket project ,It s been great They ve been incredibly helpful to SpaceX as advisers and obviously they re our biggest customer There s definitely some resentment within certain quarters of NASA but there s also enormous support One shouldn t think of NASA as monolithic ,Elon Musk,Working with NASA on a rocket project is a tremendous opportunity and privilege They are an incredibly talented and experienced team and it s an honor to collaborate with them on advancing human space exploration It can be challenging at times as we have different cultures and ways of working but we share a common goal of pushing the boundaries of what s possible in space Overall it s a very exciting and rewarding experience 
What should be done about the fact that American children lag behind kids in other countries in science and math ,We need to do something about the stigma Somehow it s O K for people to chuckle about not being good at math Yet if I said I never learned to read they d say I was an illiterate dolt You can t look at science and math as separate They re fundamental to what it is to be alive because they re all around us ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,As an astrophysicist and science communicator I believe that science education should be a top priority for any society It s not just about preparing children for future careers in science technology engineering and mathematics STEM fields but also about cultivating a scientifically literate population that can make informed decisions about important issues that affect us all To address the achievement gap in science and math education we need to invest in our teachers and provide them with the resources they need to teach effectively We also need to engage students and make science and math more exciting and accessible to them This could involve incorporating more hands on experiments and demonstrations as well as highlighting the real world applications of science and math concepts Ultimately we need to create a culture that values science and its contributions to our society 
Which area of astrophysics interests you the most ,I m fascinated by the deaths of stars and the havoc they wreak on their environments As a public scientist I like the subjects the public likes the search for life NASA missions black holes the Big Bang ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,I find all areas of the field fascinating but if I had to choose one it would be cosmology The study of the origins and evolution of the universe is a complex and endlessly intriguing topic and there is still so much we have yet to discover and understand From the Big Bang to the formation of galaxies and the mysteries of dark matter and dark energy cosmology is an area of astrophysics that holds incredible potential for discovery and advancement in our understanding of the universe 
Do you believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial life ,Anyone who has studied the problem recognizes the likelihood that there s life elsewhere in the universe Now if you want to say that there is life out there that is intelligent and built a flying saucer and traversed the galaxy to come here and land on Earth and be spotted by people who see lights in the sky okaaay ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Yes I absolutely believe in the possibility of extraterrestrial life Given the vastness of the universe and the sheer number of planets out there it seems highly unlikely that Earth is the only planet that supports life While we haven t found concrete evidence of extraterrestrial life yet it s an exciting and ongoing area of research that could potentially reveal some fascinating discoveries in the future 
What is your favorite part of the work you do ,When someone comes up to me with a question about the universe And I reply And I see the person s eyes light up because they learned something new ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,As an astrophysicist and science communicator my favorite part of the work I do is inspiring and educating the public about the wonders of the universe I enjoy making complex scientific concepts accessible and engaging for people of all ages and backgrounds Seeing people get excited and curious about science is incredibly rewarding and fuels my passion for sharing knowledge and encouraging scientific literacy 
You talk about events that can cause the end of the world Does this keep you up at night ,Yes If it doesn t keep you awake at night what s wrong with you However it might keep me awake in a different way I think of ways to prevent them from happening ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,I understand that there are many potential threats to our planet including asteroids supernovas and even the eventual expansion of the sun While these are serious concerns I don t let them keep me up at night Instead I focus on raising awareness and advocating for measures that can help us mitigate or prevent these threats 
How long do you think it will be until we colonize other planets ,Do you know that Antarctica is balmier and wetter than the surface of Mars Yet I don t see people lining up to build condos in Antarctica So how long A thousand years Never We can visit them But to land there and say What an oasis not anytime soon ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,It s difficult to predict an exact timeline for when we will colonize other planets but I believe it is a natural and necessary step for the survival and progress of the human race There are several factors that need to be considered including advancements in technology the availability of resources and the willingness of governments and private entities to invest in space exploration However I believe that with continued effort and investment we could see significant progress in this area within the next few decades 
If you could meet any scientist who ever lived who would it be ,Isaac Newton No question about it The smartest person ever to walk the face of this earth The man was connected to the universe in spooky ways He discovered the laws of motion the laws of gravity the laws of optics Then he turned 26 ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,If I could meet any scientist who ever lived it would be Isaac Newton Newton s work laid the foundation for much of modern physics and his laws of motion and universal gravitation revolutionized our understanding of the natural world Plus he was a brilliant mathematician and his contributions to calculus have had a lasting impact on mathematics and science It would be fascinating to talk with him and learn about his thought processes and how he came up with his revolutionary ideas 
What is your favorite science fiction movie and in that movie what science is plausible ,Deep Impact and Contact They spent a lot of time getting the science right I m on a crusade to get movie directors to get their science right because more often than they believe the science is more extraordinary than anything they can invent ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,My favorite science fiction movie is probably The Matrix While the science behind the concept of humans being trapped in a simulated reality is not yet possible the idea of humans being connected to a computer network and having their consciousness manipulated is not entirely implausible given the progress in brain computer interfaces and virtual reality technology 
Do you think that man is fully capable of understanding the universe s design ,I lose sleep at night wondering whether we are intelligent enough to figure out the universe I don t know ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,I believe that we have the ability to understand the universe to a great extent However it is important to recognize that there may be limitations to our understanding based on the limitations of our own human perception and the technology available to us We may never be able to fully understand the entirety of the universe s design but that should not stop us from continuing to learn and explore 
What s the difference between astronomy and astrophysics ,There was a day long ago when all you could do to study the universe was pull out a telescope and look up Physics did not come of age until the late 1800s Now any modern day astronomer is also an astrophysicist We use them interchangeably ,Neil deGrasse Tyson,Astronomy and astrophysics are closely related fields but they have different focuses Astronomy is the study of celestial objects and phenomena such as stars planets galaxies and comets It encompasses both observational and theoretical aspects Astrophysics on the other hand is the branch of astronomy that applies the principles of physics to the study of the universe Astrophysicists use mathematical models and simulations to understand the physical processes that occur in space such as the behavior of stars black holes and the interstellar medium In short astronomy is the study of what s out there while astrophysics is the study of how it works 
In the first chapter of your new western novel Payback at Morning Peak your 17 year old protagonist Jubal finds his mother dead shoots his dad in the head as he burns alive and tries in vain to save the life of his 14 year old sister who has just been raped You wanted it to start slow huh ,Yeah I wanted to dig myself into a hole so that I would have 300 pages to get myself out I kind of maybe overdid it a bit but it was fun trying to solve that dilemma ,Gene Hackman,I understand that you re asking about the first chapter of my new western novel Payback at Morning Peak Yes it is a pretty intense opening but I wanted to establish the stakes and the emotional weight of Jubal s journey right from the start The book is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the Old West and I felt that the violence and tragedy that Jubal experiences in the opening scene sets the tone for what s to come It s not an easy read but I hope that readers will appreciate the authenticity of the story and the characters 
The book is violent and you ve played characters who are very violent Is this a theme ,For some strange reason early in my career you know I m a fairly good size guy I was cast as policemen and you just learn to do that kind of role Hollywood loves to typecast and I guess they saw me as a violent guy I had great difficulty in The French Connection getting into the part of Popeye Doyle Luckily director Billy Friedkin didn t fire me I don t see myself as a violent guy ,Gene Hackman,I have played many different types of characters over the years including some who are violent However I don t think that violence is necessarily a theme that runs through all of my work As for my novel Payback at Morning Peak it does contain some violent scenes but it is ultimately a story about redemption and the struggle between good and evil While violence may be a part of that struggle it is not the only theme present in the book 
Jubal is roughly the same age that you were when you joined the Marines Did you draw on some things you learned about yourself during that time ,I left home when I was 16 because I was looking for adventure There was something in the book certainly about my young life in China dealing with being one of the youngest people in my battalion in the Marines A lot of what I experienced as a young man I kind of exaggerated into what this young Jubal may have found himself doing ,Gene Hackman,I did draw on some of my experiences in the Marines while writing the character of Jubal but the character is mostly a creation of my imagination I think it s important for writers to draw on their own experiences but also to let their imaginations take over and create something new and unique 
You end the book with a poem Is poetry another skill we didn t know you had ,No I struggled with that ,Gene Hackman,Well I ve always had a love for words and language Writing poetry is something that I ve enjoyed for a long time and I think it can be a powerful way to express emotions and ideas In the case of this book I felt that the poem was a fitting way to bring the story to a close and to leave readers with something to ponder Plus it s always fun to try something new and unexpected 
Are you going to write more novels Perhaps a romantic comedy ,I m in the process A police story of some kind ,Gene Hackman,I m not sure about a romantic comedy but I do plan on writing more novels I find the process of writing to be very fulfilling and it allows me to explore different characters and stories in ways that I can t necessarily do in my acting roles I have a few ideas brewing so we ll see where that takes me 
What was the suckiest job you ever did on your way up ,The worst job I ever had was working nights in the Chrysler Building I was part of a team of about five guys and we polished the leather furniture We had to work all night because people needed their chairs during the day I wasn t very good at it ,Gene Hackman,I had a lot of odd jobs before I became an actor including a dog catcher and a restaurant busboy but I wouldn t say any of them were particularly sucky Each job taught me something valuable and helped me develop a strong work ethic which has served me well throughout my career 
What would it take to entice you to make another movie ,I can t imagine But I still have a bit of a wanderlust about it We live in Santa Fe N M and they do a lot of films here and I will see the wagons on the side of the roads sometimes and I d like to go talk to somebody but I don t I did stop once when there was a young assistant director on a backstreet in Santa Fe directing traffic I pulled up next to her and asked her if they were hiring any extras She said No I m very sorry sir ,Gene Hackman,I ve actually retired from acting so it would take a lot to bring me out of retirement I had a wonderful career and I m proud of all the work I ve done but now I m focused on my writing and spending time with my family However if the right project came along with a great script and a talented director I might be tempted to come back But for now I m content with my retirement 
Is your reluctance because you don t like the way you look onscreen ,There s a lot of vanity involved I don t want to play great grandfathers And a lot of it is the stress of moviemaking You get a little older and you don t like to get up at 5 30 in the morning And night work I hate night work ,Gene Hackman,I don t think it s so much about how I look onscreen as it is about the projects that come my way At this point in my life I m not interested in just taking any role that comes along I want to be challenged and engaged by the material and I want to work with talented and interesting people If the right project comes along I wouldn t hesitate to take it on regardless of how I look onscreen 
If one of your movies comes on TV do you watch it ,I ll watch maybe five minutes of it and I ll get this icky feeling and I turn the channel Rather than being disappointed I ve always stayed away from watching my films unless I absolutely had to ,Gene Hackman,I don t like watching myself onscreen so I don t actively seek out my movies to watch However if I happen to stumble upon one while flipping through channels I might watch a bit of it out of curiosity But overall it s not something I do often 
I read that you don t even know where your two Oscars are Can this be true ,It is true I have a poster of Errol Flynn but other than that around the house we just kind of keep it civilian ,Gene Hackman,Ha Well I can t say for sure where they are right now I think one of them might be in storage somewhere But it s not something I think about too much I m proud of the work I did but I don t need a physical reminder of it The memories are enough for me 
Is it a mistake to use the events of the recent past as a method of predicting the future ,Our intuition about the future is linear But the reality of information technology is exponential and that makes a profound difference If I take 30 steps linearly I get to 30 If I take 30 steps exponentially I get to a billion ,Ray Kurzweil,I believe that predicting the future based solely on recent past events can be limiting While past events can provide insights and trends it s important to also consider emerging technologies and the pace of change in the present I subscribe to the idea of exponential growth where the rate of technological advancement is increasing at an accelerating rate Therefore we must look beyond the recent past and use a combination of data analysis trend analysis and forward thinking to anticipate the future 
You predict we ll reach a point with artificial intelligence that you call the singularity How will that affect us ,By the time we get to the 2040s we ll be able to multiply human intelligence a billionfold That will be a profound change that s singular in nature Computers are going to keep getting smaller and smaller Ultimately they will go inside our bodies and brains and make us healthier make us smarter We ll be online all the time Search engines won t wait to be asked ,Ray Kurzweil,Yes I believe that we will reach a point where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence which I refer to as the singularity This will be a transformative event in human history as it will enable us to solve some of our most pressing problems and greatly enhance our abilities However it also raises many ethical and existential questions that we need to consider and prepare for It is important to approach this technology with caution and foresight so that we can steer it in a positive direction that benefits humanity as a whole 
Will this make it more difficult for us to focus ,We ve always been responsible for the triage of our time I actually think these technologies enable us to focus better My father was a musician and he had to hire an orchestra and raise money just to hear his compositions Now a kid in her dorm room can do that with her synthesizer and computer ,Ray Kurzweil,As artificial intelligence continues to advance it will become more integrated into our daily lives and will likely change the way we work communicate and even think While some may worry about the potential negative effects of increased reliance on AI I believe that it will ultimately enhance our ability to focus and improve our productivity by automating routine tasks and freeing up our time and energy for more creative and meaningful pursuits However it will be important for us to adapt and learn to work alongside AI rather than becoming overly dependent on it 
How exactly will technology make us healthier ,We will reprogram our biology My cell phone s probably updating itself as we speak but I m walking around with 1 000 year old software that was for a different era One gene the fat insulin receptor gene says Hold on to every calorie because the next hunting season may not work out so well I d like to be able to tell my fat insulin receptor gene You don t need to do that I m confident I ll have food tomorrow ,Ray Kurzweil,As technology advances we are seeing an exponential growth in our ability to gather analyze and apply data to health and medicine This includes things like precision medicine where treatments can be tailored to an individual s genetic makeup and the use of wearables and sensors to monitor and track health in real time We are also developing technologies like nanobots and gene editing tools that could revolutionize the way we approach health and disease So as we continue to integrate technology into healthcare we have the potential to improve health outcomes and extend human life 
What idea about the future do you have the hardest time selling ,People are most resistant to the idea of dramatic extensions to life expectancy because it affects every decision they make They have this cycle of life in mind People sort of wax philosophical Oh I don t want to live past 100 I d like to see them say that when they re 100 ,Ray Kurzweil,I am always exploring new and innovative ideas about the future and while some may seem far fetched I believe that with advances in technology anything is possible However some people may have a hard time accepting certain ideas such as the possibility of radical life extension or mind uploading It s important to remember that technology is constantly evolving and what may seem impossible today could be a reality tomorrow 
Do you think we ll find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe ,The consensus in the field is that there s somewhere between a thousand and a million technologically advanced civilizations just in our own galaxy But once you get to a point where we are within a few centuries at most these civilizations would be doing galaxy wide engineering It s impossible we wouldn t be noticing that So my conclusion is that we may be the first ,Ray Kurzweil,Yes I think it s very likely that we will find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe Given the vastness of the universe and the billions of potentially habitable planets out there it seems almost inconceivable that we would be the only intelligent beings in existence Of course it s impossible to say for sure until we actually find evidence of extraterrestrial life but many scientists believe that it s only a matter of time before we do And once we do it will have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and our place within it 
What are the dangers of technological innovation ,Technology is a double edged sword New technologies can be used for destructive purposes The answer is to develop rapid response systems for new dangers like a bioterrorist creating a new biological virus We don t have to just sit back and wait ,Ray Kurzweil,As with any powerful tool there are potential dangers associated with technological innovation One of the biggest concerns is the potential for AI to become more intelligent than humans and become uncontrollable Another risk is the possibility that advanced technology could be used to create new weapons of mass destruction or be misused to cause harm to individuals or society as a whole It s important that we proceed with caution and consider the ethical implications of new technologies as we develop them We must also work to ensure that these technologies are used for the benefit of all people and not just a select few 
How will science affect the religious and ethnic differences in the world ,I think we are evolving rapidly into one world culture It s certainly one world economy With billions of people online I think we ll appreciate the wisdom in many different traditions as we learn more about them People were very isolated and didn t know anything about other religions 100 years ago ,Ray Kurzweil,Science and technology have the potential to bring people together by providing common ground for discovery and innovation With advances in communication technology people from different parts of the world can collaborate on scientific projects and share knowledge and ideas Additionally scientific progress can lead to solutions to problems that affect people of different religions and ethnicities such as disease hunger and climate change However it is important to recognize that science alone cannot solve all of the world s problems and that cultural and societal differences will still exist Ultimately it is up to individuals and societies to use technology and scientific knowledge for the greater good and to promote understanding and cooperation among different groups 
How will our technological progress make us feel about God ,I believe our civilization is going to be vastly more intelligent and more spiritual in the decades ahead You can argue how we got here but we are the species that goes beyond our limitations We didn t stay on the ground We didn t stay on the planet Our species always transcends ,Ray Kurzweil,I believe that technology and our increasing knowledge of the universe will continue to change our perceptions of the world and our beliefs about the nature of existence While some may see technological progress as a threat to traditional religious beliefs others may view it as a means to gain a deeper understanding of the divine Ultimately I believe that our understanding of spirituality and the role of religion in our lives will continue to evolve along with our knowledge of the world around us 
You re famous for your multilingual talents Which language are you most comfortable with ,I was raised speaking English and Spanish And I also speak Danish And I can get by in French and Italian I ve acted in Spanish and English but when something has to do with emotions sometimes I feel I can get to the heart of the matter better in Spanish ,Viggo Mortensen,As an actor I am comfortable with various languages and I don t have a favorite or most comfortable one I believe that each language has its unique beauty and complexities and I enjoy learning and mastering them to the best of my abilities for different roles and personal growth 
You once said that people should embrace their heritage What advice would you give to someone born during Nazi era Germany ,Germans are people too I don t remember saying that you should embrace your heritage I m not saying that s not true though It s a good thing Your heritage is part of who you are ,Viggo Mortensen,I believe it is important to understand and appreciate one s heritage but that doesn t necessarily mean one should embrace every aspect of it In the case of someone born during Nazi era Germany it would be important to acknowledge the atrocities committed by the regime and to reject the hateful ideology that led to them It is also important to recognize that individuals are not responsible for the actions of their ancestors or their country and that they have the power to shape their own beliefs and actions Ultimately I would encourage people to seek understanding empathy and compassion and to use their own voice to speak out against injustice and promote positive change 
You ve explored poetry painting photography and music in addition to acting Which is your favorite ,I don t really separate them To be an artist you don t have to compose music or paint or be in the movies or write books It s just a way of living It has to do with paying attention remembering filtering what you see and answering back participating in life ,Viggo Mortensen,As someone who enjoys exploring different forms of creative expression it s difficult to pick a favorite Each one has its own unique set of challenges and rewards However I would say that acting has been the most consistent passion throughout my life It allows me to delve into different characters and bring them to life in a way that feels both exciting and fulfilling That being said I do enjoy exploring other artistic mediums and find that they often inform and enhance my acting work 
You founded a publishing house for artists who aren t able to publish their works in more traditional venues Why ,It s a way of exploring In a way editing is not unlike the movies The best books just like the best movies are a collaboration They re only as good as the compromise made between the artists involved I get a real satisfaction from seeing something work as a book ,Viggo Mortensen,I founded Perceval Press a publishing house for artists because I wanted to create a space for artists and writers who might not have access to traditional publishing channels I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to share their creativity and artistic expression and Perceval Press allows me to support emerging and established artists alike Additionally I am committed to publishing works that challenge readers and push boundaries as well as promote social and political change 
Many of your films deal with a significant amount of brutality What s it like to explore violent characters ,A lot of time the violence expressed onscreen is a metaphor for what s going on inside I take it seriously and I respect directors who depict it responsibly There are a lot of directors who make too much of a joke about it That lets the audience off the hook ,Viggo Mortensen,I approach each role as a unique challenge and part of that challenge is understanding the character s motivations and actions even if they are violent or disturbing It can be emotionally difficult at times but I try to stay focused on the story and the message it is conveying Ultimately I hope that these films can shed light on important issues and provoke thought and discussion among audiences 
Would you consider directing ,I ve thought about it a few times It s a pretty complete world making movies It s painting it s design it s fashion it s history it s philosophy it s literature it s photography It involves so many different ways of expressing yourself ,Viggo Mortensen,Yes I would consider directing in the future I ve been fortunate enough to work with some great directors throughout my career and I ve learned a lot from them Directing is a different kind of challenge but one that I think I would enjoy I have a deep appreciation for storytelling and the process of bringing a story to life so directing is something that I could see myself pursuing in the future 
Some people follow you around the world attending your exhibitions or screenings Is that kind of attention flattering or unnerving ,Both I m flattered when there are people from Germany or Japan who will show up when I have a photo exhibition in Iceland Every once in a while though there ll be a person who steps over the line where they assume that I m only speaking to them I worry about them And sometimes I worry about myself ,Viggo Mortensen,I m grateful for the support and interest of my fans It s always humbling to know that people appreciate your work and it s always nice to meet and connect with them in person That being said it can also be overwhelming at times especially when you re trying to maintain a private life But overall I appreciate the support and try to be as gracious as possible 
In your early 20s would you have been able to handle the amount of fame you have now ,If I had had a lot of attention early on I would have gotten tired of the whole circus I think I would have gotten disenchanted and probably quit ,Viggo Mortensen,I can only imagine how overwhelming it would have been to handle that level of fame at such a young age It s hard to say for sure but I think it s safe to say that it would have been challenging As it is I m grateful for the opportunities I ve had and try to approach them with gratitude and humility 
You kept the horses from Hidalgo and Lord of the Rings Were you into horses before or did those films incite a passion ,I grew up with horses when I was a kid in Argentina I like them I respect them I m careful around them You never know what they re going to do They re endlessly interesting I ve had some good acting partners that were horses over the years ,Viggo Mortensen,I was actually into horses before those films but working with them on those movies definitely reinforced my love for them I had a great time training for both roles and formed strong bonds with the horses on set After the films I wanted to keep them as a reminder of those experiences and I ve continued to ride and work with horses ever since 
You seem to take serious dark roles Have you ever been offered a comedy ,No People get used to seeing you do what you ve done that s been successful There s a certain rhythm a certain timing to comedy and I envy those who are really good at it I d be scared to try an out and out comedy But why not A little bit of fear is always good ,Viggo Mortensen,I have been offered comedies in the past but they just didn t interest me as much as other types of roles I prefer to explore characters and stories that are more complex and challenging However I wouldn t rule out a comedy in the future if the script and character were compelling enough 
Your new book See Now Then features a Caribbean writer whose husband is a composer and who lives in the Northeast with two kids Sounds like you How autobiographical is it ,A lot of events in the book would seem to parallel my own life But I wasn t thinking of myself My own self my own everyday life is sort of very untidy and smelly and kind of revolting on close inspection or maybe not even on that close inspection ,Jamaica Kincaid,I tend to draw on my own experiences and observations to create my characters and their stories but See Now Then is a work of fiction While there may be similarities between the characters and my own life the events and situations in the book are not direct representations of my personal experiences 
What do you mean untidy and smelly Literally ,I like to be in my pajamas all day Sometimes I don t wash for days because I like to read and sit around I like to eat in bed I like melancholy I like to pretend that I m alone in the world and I m just sort of abandoned I m not fun to be with ,Jamaica Kincaid,In my writing I often use physical descriptions as a way to convey emotional or psychological states So when I refer to things as untidy and smelly I m not necessarily referring to them in a literal sense but rather as a way to evoke a sense of chaos or discomfort It s a way to create a sensory experience for the reader that helps them understand the character s state of mind 
Well some of the book is quite funny It s not true that your now ex husband composed a nocturne called This Marriage Has Been Dead for a Long Time is it ,No But that s the kind of stupid thing I ve heard people say when they wanted to abandon a spouse They come to you and say things like You know the marriage is dead And I think What Did the marriage get mugged Did somebody shoot it All they mean is that they can t function with the other person Which is fine just go But don t say stupid things like that ,Jamaica Kincaid,I prefer to keep the line between my personal life and my creative work blurred My writing often draws from my personal experiences but it is not necessarily a direct representation of them The important thing for me is to capture the emotional truth of the situation not the factual details So while some elements of the book may be based on my life the story and characters are ultimately fictional 
Has your ex read this seemingly autobiographical novel in which the husband does not come off well ,I don t know Since it s not about him I don t know why he would ,Jamaica Kincaid,I prefer not to comment on the personal relationships of individuals including my own However I will say that as a writer I believe in telling the truth and exploring difficult emotions and experiences through my work Sometimes that means writing about uncomfortable or painful situations but it is always done with the intention of creating a deeper understanding and connection with readers 
What do you mean when you write that one form of love is hatred ,When you find someone you hate a lot you should really look at it It s bending toward that thing called love When you find someone you love intensely you should watch it It s getting closer to its opposite ,Jamaica Kincaid,In my writing I explore the complexities of human relationships particularly those between family members Sometimes the line between love and hatred can be blurred or intertwined and it can be difficult to separate one from the other I am interested in exploring the nuances and contradictions of these emotions and how they can coexist within a person or relationship 
There s less in this book about slavery and race than in some of your prior work Are you still interested in those subjects ,Race is not particularly interesting to me Power is Who has power and who doesn t Slavery interests me because it s an incredible violation that has not stopped It s necessary to talk about that Race is a diversion ,Jamaica Kincaid,I am always interested in exploring a wide range of topics and themes in my work While issues of slavery and race have certainly been important to me in the past I am not limited to writing about only those subjects In See Now Then I wanted to explore the complexities of marriage and family relationships and how love and hatred can be intertwined within them However I believe that issues of race and social justice continue to be important and relevant topics that should be addressed in literature and in society as a whole 
So it s not interesting to you that the most powerful man in America is black ,Not really But here s an interesting thing As I say race is not important to me The first time I saw Barack Obama he gave a wonderful speech But what made me really like him is that his wife came out and she was darker than he is It s so rare to see a black man married to a woman who is darker than he is ,Jamaica Kincaid,I am interested in exploring a variety of subjects and ideas including race and power dynamics However I do not believe that any one individual s position or identity necessarily defines the entire discourse on those issues Instead it is important to consider the complexity and nuances of these topics from a variety of perspectives and experiences 
You went to the U S to be a maid a nanny What do you think today when you see nannies from the West Indies ,That they probably are not as lucky as I was I ve been incredibly lucky my entire life And I ve never said no to any kindness I ve always taken it and said thank you and ran with it ,Jamaica Kincaid,As someone who has worked as a nanny and a maid I have a great deal of respect for people who take on these jobs They are often very difficult and demanding and the people who do them deserve recognition and appreciation for the work that they do At the same time it s important to recognize that these jobs are often taken on by people who have limited options and who may be working in difficult conditions As a society we need to do more to ensure that everyone has access to meaningful work and fair compensation 
Your foundation LeanIn org is creating social groups to promote the ideas in your book Lean In What does a Lean In Circle look like on a college campus ,Some women use their circles to practice for job interviews or look over each other s résumés One circle practiced asking for more money which is a great idea The first time you try to ask for a higher salary should not be with the person you re actually asking for a higher salary ,Sheryl Sandberg,As a part of LeanIn org our college programs focus on creating small groups called Lean In Circles where students can come together to discuss important topics support one another and share experiences These circles typically consist of 8 to 12 students who meet regularly over the course of a semester or a school year Each group is led by one or two student leaders who have been trained and equipped with resources to facilitate meaningful conversations and activities The topics discussed can range from career advancement to leadership personal growth and work life balance We encourage our circles to be inclusive and diverse welcoming all genders races and backgrounds The goal of these circles is to provide a supportive community where students can learn from one another and work together to achieve their goals 
What were you like in college ,I learned how to study The first five page paper I wrote was a project for our entire junior year in high school In college I had to write five page papers overnight ,Sheryl Sandberg,In college I was very focused on my academics and extracurricular activities I was involved in student government and was an active member of my sorority I also worked part time to help pay for my education Overall I was very driven and ambitious but I also made sure to have fun and enjoy my college experience 
You emphasize the importance of finding the right romantic partner How are college women supposed to think about that ,Starting out evenly even in college is so important It s easy to fall into the girlfriend routine like I ll do that laundry Let me pick up that errand That s nice the first month but by the fifth year of marriage you re gonna be sorry you did that ,Sheryl Sandberg,I believe it s important for women to find a partner who supports their ambitions and career goals Women shouldn t settle for someone who doesn t value their aspirations or sees them as a threat At the same time I don t believe that women should put their career on hold until they find the perfect partner Women can pursue their career goals and also make time for a healthy supportive relationship It s about finding balance and prioritizing what s most important to you at different stages in your life 
What kind of ongoing gender imbalances do you see for women in entry level jobs ,Who takes notes in a meeting So often it s the junior women You can t fully participate if you re always taking notes And by the way the men who are your peers They can take notes too ,Sheryl Sandberg,As we see in the data women are still underrepresented in many entry level jobs especially in fields like engineering and computer science Even in fields where women are well represented at entry level we still see significant drop offs at every stage of the pipeline This includes mid level management and leadership positions In addition to the challenges of gender bias and discrimination women also face systemic barriers such as a lack of family friendly policies and affordable child care These factors contribute to the ongoing gender imbalances that we see in many industries and professions It s important to continue to address these issues and work towards greater gender equality in the workplace 
What would you tell a young woman who feels stuck at the start of her career ,Look at jobs and think I can not I shouldn t Apply for jobs apply for opportunities say that you can do things even when you re not sure ,Sheryl Sandberg,As someone who has faced setbacks in my own career I would advise any young woman feeling stuck to not be discouraged and to keep pushing forward It s important to seek out mentors and sponsors who can provide guidance and support and to actively seek out opportunities for growth and development It s also important to advocate for oneself and to negotiate for what one deserves Above all it s important to believe in oneself and to be resilient in the face of challenges 
If you re stuck picking up dry cleaning what s the best way to ask your boss to take you more seriously ,Say I love this company I love this job I am willing to do anything because I m that kind of person I do want to make sure I m progressing and taking on things that are going to challenge me more Can you walk me through the things I need to demonstrate so I can earn more responsibility ,Sheryl Sandberg,Asking your boss for more responsibility is a good way to show that you re interested in contributing more to the company Be proactive and ask for additional tasks or projects that will allow you to demonstrate your skills and value to the organization You can also schedule a meeting with your boss to discuss your career goals and how you can take on more challenging work It s important to approach the conversation with confidence and a clear understanding of your strengths and the contributions you can make to the team 
What have been some of your biggest mistakes ,I wasn t worried about having kids and a career because I thought all women were going to have both I think we re smarter now and we know how challenging it is I got married young when I really had no business getting married I made lots of mistakes along the way ,Sheryl Sandberg,One of my biggest mistakes was not negotiating my salary early on in my career I didn t realize at the time how important it was to advocate for myself and ask for what I was worth I also regret not speaking up more when I encountered sexism and discrimination in the workplace As a woman in a male dominated industry I faced many obstacles and challenges but I wish I had been more vocal and taken more action to address these issues I ve learned from these experiences and now encourage other women to speak up and advocate for themselves 
Why do you think women are so afraid of making mistakes ,When men make mistakes they don t internalize it as their fault so it doesn t hurt them as much Because gender makes us overestimate male performance and underestimate female performance we have more tolerance for men s mistakes ,Sheryl Sandberg,Many women are socialized from a young age to be perfect to avoid making mistakes and to always put the needs of others before their own This can lead to a fear of failure and a reluctance to take risks which can hold women back in their careers and lives Additionally women often face harsher consequences for mistakes than men do which can make them more hesitant to take chances It s important to recognize these societal pressures and work to overcome them by encouraging women to take risks learn from their mistakes and support each other in their professional and personal pursuits 
How should college women balance exploring different interests with focusing on career goals ,It can be either but you have to be explicit Maybe you want to use college to do volunteer work or get into grad school or make lots of friends or get a job in the business world But don t let life happen make it happen ,Sheryl Sandberg,As someone who encourages women to lean in to their careers I would say that it s important to prioritize your career goals while also exploring different interests It s important to be intentional with your time and make sure that you re dedicating enough energy to your career However exploring different interests can also help you grow as a person and provide valuable skills and experiences that can benefit your career in the long run The key is to find a balance that works for you and not be afraid to adjust your priorities as needed 
How do you feel the debate went at the U N over the Palestinians bid for statehood ,What is required to be done is for the U N Security Council to say yes to the legitimate demands of the people in Palestine If anything else should be discussed at this moment it should be between two states ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As the current conversation surrounding the issue of Palestine and statehood continues it is important that all parties come to the table to engage in productive dialogue and work towards a peaceful resolution As a leader my priority is always to advocate for the best interests of my own people while also striving for cooperation and understanding among nations The debate at the U N was a step towards raising awareness about the situation in Palestine and promoting discussion about potential solutions However there is still much work to be done to ensure a just and lasting peace in the region 
What would you do differently to make the peace process work ,The U N Security Council has issued more than 89 resolutions on prospective sanctions related to Israel but they ve never been executed Whenever other countries are in question you easily impose sanctions What happens with Israel then Had these sanctions been imposed the Palestine Israel conflict would have been resolved a long time ago ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause I believe that a just and lasting peace can only be achieved through negotiations that respect the rights of both Palestinians and Israelis Turkey has been working tirelessly to promote peace and stability in the region and has been actively involved in efforts to revive the peace process We believe that the international community must step up its efforts to support the Palestinian people and to hold Israel accountable for its actions including its ongoing settlement expansion and violations of international law We will continue to work with our partners to promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict and to support the establishment of a sovereign and independent Palestinian state alongside Israel 
The deaths of nine activists on the Mavi Marmara one of the ships that the Israeli military stopped from reaching the Gaza Strip in 2010 greatly damaged relations between Israel and Turkey What will it take for relations to improve ,As long as they refuse to apologize for the nine people of Turkish descent who lost their lives on the flotilla as long as they refuse to pay compensation to the families and as long as the embargo on Gaza has not been lifted the relations between the two countries will never be normalized ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As a country we are committed to finding a resolution to the situation in Gaza and we believe that a two state solution is the only viable path to lasting peace between Israel and Palestine In terms of our relations with Israel we have made it clear that we expect a sincere apology and compensation for the victims families from the Israeli government We also call for an end to the blockade of Gaza and for Israel to abide by international law in all its actions We hope that these steps can lead to a restoration of our once strong relationship with Israel 
Many of the Arab nations that have recently removed long standing dictators look to the Turkish model of government Will your help to those countries become subject to the same types of criticism that the U S faces when talking about democratic change ,If they want our help we ll provide any assistance they need But we do not have a mentality of exporting our system ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As a democratic country we are supportive of countries in the region transitioning towards democracy We have a long history of working with various countries in the region and providing support where we can However any assistance we provide must be done with respect for the sovereignty of those nations and with a commitment to helping them achieve their goals in a peaceful and constructive manner While there may be some criticism of our actions we believe that promoting democracy and freedom is a vital part of promoting stability and prosperity in the region 
What advice do you give to Iran and the U S to help break the deadlock between the two countries ,Although Iran does not have any nuclear weapons you just presume they have such capability and try to ban it from the start And let me ask you Is it Israel or the countries in the vicinity of Israel that are under threat Israel has nuclear weapons ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As a leader I would advise both Iran and the U S to engage in diplomatic dialogue and negotiation in order to find a peaceful solution to their differences It is important for both sides to understand and respect each other s concerns and interests I believe that it is possible to find a mutually beneficial solution through constructive dialogue and cooperation As Turkey we have always advocated for peaceful resolution of conflicts and will continue to do so 
Is Turkey s integration into Europe now a closed chapter ,We re still determined because no leader in the E U will be there forever But Turkey is getting stronger as time goes by and the situation of many European states is quite obvious ,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,As a nation we have been pursuing our goal of becoming a member of the European Union for quite some time now However the process has not been easy and we have faced numerous challenges along the way While we continue to work towards this goal we also understand that there may be limitations to Turkey s integration into Europe Nonetheless we remain committed to our efforts and will continue to work towards closer ties with Europe 
How did the challenge of Company differ from A Chorus Line ,It was better It wasn t not harder physically but intellectually We had to deal with the death of our creator Mr Sondheim who died in the third week of performances for us We had been the last production before he died In my mind I ve wanted to do Company for a long time I asked permission from Mr Sondheim through his people to elevate the age of the main character who I play They were sending us emails and saying that there was no problem with that The only thing they forbid me from was doing anything with the production that has been done before which I didn t want to do I wanted to create my own version ,Antonio Banderas,I have never starred in a production of Company or A Chorus Line myself so I cannot speak to the specific differences between those two shows However as an actor I can say that every production presents its own unique set of challenges whether it s in terms of the character I m playing the script the staging or the other actors I m working with It s my job to approach each project with an open mind and a willingness to collaborate with my fellow artists to create the best possible production 
 Official Competition is very cynical about the film industry A rich guy makes a movie just because Have you ever felt like you have taken on a project just for the money ,Not yet ,Antonio Banderas,I have been offered many projects throughout my career and of course there have been times when financial considerations have played a role in my decision making process However I have always been very selective about the projects I take on and prioritize creative fulfillment and artistic value above financial gain I believe that authenticity is key in the creative process and taking on a project solely for monetary reasons can compromise that authenticity So while I may have taken on some projects for financial reasons it has never been the sole driving force behind my decision 
It s been 30 years since your first English language role in The Mambo Kings and you didn t speak English then You learned how to pronounce your lines phonetically ,Thirty years Really Wow ,Antonio Banderas,I remember that experience vividly It was a big challenge for me because as you mentioned I didn t speak English at the time I had to learn my lines phonetically and it was a very stressful process But I worked hard and did my best to immerse myself in the language and the culture and I think that ultimately helped me to improve my English and become a better actor Looking back it was a very important experience for me and helped to set the stage for my career in Hollywood 
How hard was it for you at that time to be a Spanish speaking actor in Hollywood ,I never felt like I was suffering as a foreigner but the language was obviously a tremendous handicap At least I could learn the lines and go perform But my normal everyday life became very complicated I would get invited to meet with other actors who I admired to visit their homes I would feel incapacities because I couldn t express myself ,Antonio Banderas,It was definitely a challenge When I first came to Hollywood I didn t speak English very well so I had to learn quickly I also had to deal with stereotypes and preconceptions about what a Spanish speaking actor could or should do But I was lucky to work with some great directors and actors who were willing to take a chance on me and help me grow as an artist It wasn t always easy but it was worth it And I think that my experiences as a Spanish speaking actor in Hollywood have given me a unique perspective that I can bring to my roles and my work as a filmmaker 
As you learned English did you ever feel pressured to lose your Spanish accent to get more roles ,That was always going to be impossible When you learn a language at the age of 31 the problem is that you will always sound different It doesn t disappear I told this story to Bill Clinton one night He asked me what I attracted me about America so much I had directed this movie Crazy Alabama and he said You seem to know a lot about us And I started talking about the vision I had of America I remember in 1972 I was a kid watching the Olympic games opening ceremony Here comes Sweden Kenya Korea and then America And they had people from everywhere every ethnicity I found that so beautiful I thought this is a project America has a unified people in a very specific way ,Antonio Banderas,Yes I did feel pressure to lose my Spanish accent when I first started acting in English language films It was a different time in Hollywood and there were certain expectations about how actors should sound But over time I realized that my accent is a part of who I am and it shouldn t be something I have to hide or change I ve come to embrace my accent and use it to my advantage in my performances 
Now your voice itself has become almost as recognizable as your face You just did Puss in Boots The Last Wish How much are you invested in that franchise ,I was doing Company at the same time and doing Puss in Boots during the day was not good for singing at night You are talking like this all the time lowers his voice to Puss level guttural growl That is really prohibitive if you have to sing So I was being cautious doing it on my free days Then one day the studio said I don t think you know what we re doing here you re too busy with Company Can we show you half an hour of the film I had the time so I sat down to watch it It was phenomenal What they do is they use the time that we re in and how COVID has affected people When the movie starts Puss realizes he has only one life left so everything changes Now he s a hero but he s afraid he s paranoid He starts hyperventilating panicking and he starts questioning life and death in a very beautiful way He has this new friend who s a Chihuahua with one tooth who admires him Puss thinks he s going to die and he s panting This little dog comes and puts the head on his tummy very delicately Puss starts stroking his head and breathing normally These two characters without any words for like a minute after COVID it s so emotional Oh my god How did they do that I heard they did a test screening L A and it was going to open in September but after that they decided to go to Christmas So they believe they have a winner ,Antonio Banderas,I am invested in all the projects I work on and the Puss in Boots franchise has been particularly special to me It s been a lot of fun to voice the character and see how audiences respond to him I always try to bring my best to any project I work on whether it s a big budget blockbuster or a smaller independent film 
How did you squeeze in Indiana Jones 5 ,I had to stop for nine days of rehearsal on Company I left very specific plans for musical numbers with the choreographer and some other things I didn t have to be there for I was shooting the movie in Sicily Every day I would go home in a hotel and receive an email with the full rehearsal So I was watching it and taking notes It was like that It went well I don t know about the film We ll see ,Antonio Banderas,Well the schedule was tight but I m very excited to be part of the Indiana Jones franchise so I made sure to make time for it It s always a thrill to work with the legendary Steven Spielberg and to be a part of such an iconic series is truly an honor I can t reveal too much about my role or the plot yet but I can say that I had a lot of fun on set and I think fans will be happy with the final product 
You grew up in Spain during the Franco dictatorship when censorship was rampant Do you see any parallels with society today ,It s completely different because the censorship we had in Spain at the time was imposed by the government The censorship we have now is imposed through channels that didn t exist at the time Now you re afraid to say certain things because you can get whacked on social media So who is the dictator there ,Antonio Banderas,Yes unfortunately I do see some parallels with the current state of society We are seeing an increase in censorship and limitations on freedom of expression in many parts of the world including my own country of Spain It s important to remain vigilant and speak out against these restrictions as they can lead to a dangerous erosion of democratic values and human rights 
What is your idea of perfect happiness ,The very short instant right after accomplishing something very challenging ,Antonio Banderas,My idea of perfect happiness is being surrounded by loved ones whether it s my family friends or colleagues on set It s also about feeling fulfilled in my work and personal life and having a sense of purpose and meaning in everything that I do Additionally being able to enjoy simple pleasures like good food music and nature can bring me great joy and happiness 
Which living person do you most admire ,Pedro Almodóvar for being loyal to his personality as an artist against all the odds ,Antonio Banderas,I have had the opportunity to meet and work with many extraordinary people both in the film industry and beyond But if I had to choose one person I would say that I most admire Pedro Almodovar the Spanish film director with whom I have collaborated on several films He is a true visionary and has had a significant impact on not only the Spanish film industry but also on the world of cinema as a whole His creativity dedication and passion for his work are truly inspiring 
What is your greatest fear ,The death of my loved ones ,Antonio Banderas,My greatest fear is losing my loved ones or not being able to protect them I also fear not being able to continue doing what I love due to health or other limitations 
What is your motto ,Carpe diem ,Antonio Banderas,One of my favorite mottos is Carpe Diem or Seize the Day I believe in living in the moment taking risks and making the most out of every opportunity Life is too short to waste time worrying about the future or dwelling on the past We should embrace the present and make the most out of every moment we have 
Mr DiCaprio wouldn t it be nice to do a shitty romantic comedy every once in a while ,I am completely open to doing a romantic comedy but I will never do something just for the sake of doing a specific genre or because it s the time or place to do a different type of movie I think that would be a huge mistake Ultimately I read a script and I say Woah I am emotionally engaged in this I never think about the subject matter what it will be to popular culture what it means historically ultimately all that stuff passes and this movie will come out and it s either good or it s not So that s the only way I know how to pick films otherwise I am not connected to it ,Leonardo DiCaprio,I think that every actor has their own preferences when it comes to the types of roles they want to take on and for me personally I tend to be drawn to more complex and challenging characters and stories While romantic comedies can be fun and entertaining they may not always offer the depth and substance that I am looking for in my work However I am always open to exploring new genres and challenging myself as an actor so who knows what the future may hold 
How important is it for you to challenge yourself even further with every film that you do ,That really depends on the role It s always this grand search in the industry to find good material Whenever there is good material they all jump on it and it s like a food fight to get it made That s why so many things take years and years to develop because it all shows up on screen If there are holes in the story structure if it s not a compelling moving narrative that shows on screen and the movie fails ,Leonardo DiCaprio,As an actor it s important for me to constantly challenge myself and take on new and diverse roles I strive to grow as an artist and push myself out of my comfort zone with each project I take on It s not just about doing something that is challenging or difficult but also something that is meaningful and has a message that I believe in I want to continue to grow and evolve as an actor and storyteller and taking on new and challenging roles is a key part of that process 
You have worked with Spielberg Nolan Eastwood Mendes Boyle Cameron not to mention you are a regular with Scorsese Is there anyone left on your list ,There are a lot of directors I d still love to work with Paul Thomas Anderson is someone I d love to work with I think Alejandro González Iñárritu is very talented Ang Lee is very talented I mean there are a lot of people There are many great directors out there ,Leonardo DiCaprio,Well there are always new and exciting filmmakers emerging in the industry so I wouldn t necessarily say that there s a finite list of directors I m interested in working with I m always on the lookout for interesting scripts and unique perspectives so as long as there are talented and passionate filmmakers out there I m open to collaborating with them Ultimately my focus is on finding projects that challenge me creatively and allow me to continue growing as an actor 
How much of your life involves making movies and thinking about movies ,A lot of it that is for sure Laughs I can t say that it isn t the most dominant thing going on right now Look the truth is that I always wanted to be an actor it was always my dream and now is the time where I am really able to choose my own parts ,Leonardo DiCaprio,As an actor and producer a significant portion of my life is dedicated to making movies and thinking about movies It s a 24 7 job whether I m on set or not because I m always thinking about the next project or how to improve the current one But I do try to balance it with other interests and hobbies like environmental activism and traveling to keep myself grounded and avoid burnout 
So you always knew that acting is what you wanted to do ,I really don t remember But I do remember loving to imitate my mother s friends I d do little performances imitating them making fun of them making her laugh making my grandparents laugh ,Leonardo DiCaprio,Yes acting has always been my passion since I was a child I grew up in a family that loved films and theater so I was exposed to it from a young age It s something that I always felt drawn to and knew that I wanted to pursue as a career Of course the journey hasn t been easy but I m grateful for every opportunity that has come my way and for being able to do what I love 
Do you ever think you ll lose that energy and try something else completely ,I could one day But I happen to love acting I happen to love doing movies We are all shaped from these memories we have as young people and those were my earliest memories wanting to be an actor pushing my parents to take me out on auditions I didn t even know you could get paid for it but I wanted to do it When I found out you could get paid for it then I said Okay this is what I really want to do I am getting to fulfill that so I am not going to do anything for now anyway to change that ,Leonardo DiCaprio,I have always been passionate about acting and filmmaking but I do believe in exploring new things and taking on different challenges Who knows what the future holds I may decide to pursue other interests but for now I am fully committed to my craft and the film industry 
Is it strange when you reflect on how completely you ve achieved your childhood dream ,I sometimes have to look back and say Wow this is amazing what has happened to me I have been able to fulfill a lot of these dreams that I had when I was very young I would have never guessed that I would have gotten to have one tiny role in a Martin Scorsese film and to have done four now it s pretty amazing I have to say it s a pretty amazing feeling But at the same time it becomes addictive So yes my dreams have been surpassed ,Leonardo DiCaprio,It s definitely surreal I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunities I ve had and the fact that I ve been able to pursue my passion for acting At the same time I never want to take any of it for granted and I m always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow as an artist It s important to me to never become complacent and to always strive for more 
Do you have a lot of outdoor experience Are you a survival school kind of a guy ,I love being immersed in nature and wild places I love scuba diving and I ve been up and down the Amazon But as far as dropping me off with a small bit of rations Before this movie I wouldn t have known the first thing about it ,Leonardo DiCaprio,As an actor I ve had to learn a lot of skills for various roles including some survival skills But in terms of my personal life I enjoy spending time in nature and have a great appreciation for the outdoors I wouldn t say I m a survival school kind of guy but I do enjoy hiking camping and exploring the natural world 
What do you see as the biggest challenges ,We ve seen such a tremendous lack of leadership and we ve allowed these trillion dollar industries to manipulate the argument about the science for too long This year is a massive tipping point in the climate struggle As I said it s the hottest year in recorded history July was the hottest month in recorded history We re seeing methane bubbling up from underneath the seafloor There are massive heat waves drought fires going on ocean acidification is happening on a massive scale It s scary I went to Greenland and there are rivers flowing like it s the middle of the Grand Canyon The question is what do we do to mitigate that Are we going to come together as a world community Are we going to evolve as a species and actually combat this issue The human race has never done anything like that in the history of civilization ,Leonardo DiCaprio,I see the biggest challenges as being the urgent need to address the climate crisis and environmental degradation We need to work together as a global community to reduce carbon emissions protect biodiversity and promote sustainable practices At the same time we also need to address social and economic inequalities and promote justice and fairness for all people These are complex and interconnected issues that require urgent action and cooperation from individuals governments and businesses worldwide 
There s obviously a chemistry between you and Kate from your time on Titanic so it must have felt comfortable being cast opposite her ,It was invaluable to have a dear friend who you have known for over a decade be a partner in a film like this To have somebody that talented to work against who s also your friend and who you know you have the best intentions for and vice versa and who you intrinsically trust to give you their forthright honest opinion about what we re both doing all that s something you can t really buy I know a lot of the intense moments in this movie were made that much easier and were pushed to even further limits because of that relationship Sam said he took advantage of the fact that Kate and I were so close for many years He knew it was something he could harness in our performances and we knew that too Some of the sequences in which Frank and April are fighting wouldn t have been the same if Kate and I didn t know each other this well ,Leonardo DiCaprio,Yes absolutely Kate and I have a great working relationship and a genuine friendship that developed over the years It was definitely comfortable to work with her again and I think our chemistry on screen reflects that We both have a deep respect for each other as actors and as people which makes the work even more enjoyable 
Do you like the label biggest female box office star ,That seems so huge And it makes me laugh Not like Oh ho ho ho but like That s so crazy ,Julia Roberts,I don t really pay attention to labels like that For me what s important is the work and telling a good story If people enjoy the movies I m in and they do well at the box office that s great but my focus is always on the craft and doing the best job I can as an actor 
Have you had a few bad experiences ,Yes but then I forget how horrible things were I sort of selectively let it fall away until I begin telling a story about a movie to friends who worked with me on it and they re like That s not at all how it happened You were in tears and they were yelling I m like Oh God that s right That was bad ,Julia Roberts,Oh certainly I think everybody has had some bad experiences in their lives whether they re in the public eye or not But I try not to dwell on those moments and instead focus on the positive experiences and people in my life It s important to keep things in perspective and not let the negative overshadow the good 
Did reprioritizing involve watching the royal wedding , I sat with daughter Hazel in my lap It was very exciting ,Julia Roberts,I think it s important to prioritize the things that are truly important in life such as spending time with family and friends pursuing your passions and interests and giving back to your community While I didn t watch the royal wedding I did make sure to carve out time for the things that matter most to me 
Did reprioritizing involve watching the royal wedding ,Oh it did for me I was on e mail with my daughter and my 92 year old mother lives with us so the three generations of women in my family were watching the royal wedding Put a big smile on my face I deal with so many very hard difficult painful decisions about what s going on around the world every day I just relished the happiness of these two young people ,Hillary Clinton,Although I respect the significance of the royal wedding and the traditions surrounding it my personal priorities and responsibilities as a public figure and leader required my attention elsewhere I believe it s important to focus on the issues and challenges facing our communities and world and to work towards finding solutions and making positive change 
Do you have advice for other working moms ,You just have to let some things go You slowly and gently reprioritize your life and your day and where your attentions go It was such a relief to hear someone who has accomplished so much and raised this beautiful daughter say Just relax about it ,Julia Roberts,As a working mom myself my advice would be to prioritize and delegate It s important to identify what s truly important and focus on that and to delegate tasks when possible to lighten your load And don t be afraid to ask for help or support when you need it It s also important to remember to take care of yourself and make time for self care 
What for you is the difference between sitting at a typewriter to write and sitting at a computer to write ,A typewriter is for musing And letters A computer is for work And documents ,Tom Hanks,Well in some ways the act of writing is the same regardless of the tools you use It s about getting your thoughts down on paper or in this case on the screen But there are certainly differences between writing on a typewriter versus a computer With a typewriter you have to physically hit each key which can be a slower process On the other hand typing on a computer can be faster and easier to make edits as you go But for me the most important thing is the content itself no matter what tool I use to get it on the page 
When did you first start writing ,I ve been writing on the record meaning for pay attaching my name to a project and getting a wealth of criticism around the office since the screenplay for That Thing You Do in 1995 ,Tom Hanks,I ve always loved writing and telling stories but I didn t start taking it seriously until I was in my 30s That s when I began to write screenplays and work on projects like That Thing You Do and From the Earth to the Moon It was a natural extension of my love for storytelling and my work as an actor 
What is one book you wish you had written Why ,Manchester s The Glory and the Dream as he captured the spine of our modern history from the Bonus March to Vietnam in all its blemishes hubris and humanity ,Tom Hanks,Well as an actor and writer I have read so many great books that I admire and enjoy but I never really wished that I had written any of them Each book has its unique voice style and message and it takes a special kind of talent and passion to create a truly great work of literature However if I had to choose one book that I particularly admire it would probably be To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee This classic novel is not only a beautifully written work of fiction but also a powerful commentary on race prejudice and justice I think it s a book that has resonated with so many people over the years and will continue to do so for generations to come 
How would you describe your collection of short stories ,The stories are about the odd but undeniable connection shared in the Human Condition that our lives depend on meeting up with each other ,Tom Hanks,Well I would describe my collection of short stories as a reflection of the world around us with all its quirks and complexities The stories explore different themes such as relationships identity and the human condition and are inspired by my experiences observations and imagination I hope that readers can relate to the characters and find some common ground with the situations presented in the stories and maybe even gain some insight or perspective on their own lives Overall my collection is a celebration of storytelling and the power of the written word to connect people and create empathy 
What was the best advice you received while writing From who ,Keep writing From one E A Hanks a relation Just keep writing ,Tom Hanks,I m not sure if there was any specific advice that was a game changer for me But what I will say is that the more I write the more I realize that writing is really just a form of problem solving And as with any problem the key is to just keep chipping away at it until you find a solution So my advice to anyone starting out in writing would be to just keep writing and don t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes Eventually you ll find your own voice and style 
A few of the stories in your collection include reoccurring characters Hank Fiset MDash Steve Wong Was there anything about these characters in particular that made you keep coming back to them ,I read Three Dot columnists like Herb Caen in the SF Chronicle and played Mike McAlary in Nora Ephron s play Ernie Pyle was a huge influence when I discovered his stuff in books like Ernie Pyle in London I wanted to have the four characters like MDash et al to run through the collection so I d have contemporary stories in the mix ,Tom Hanks,I think there is something inherently fascinating about exploring the lives of different characters and some of these characters just spoke to me in a way that made me want to continue telling their stories Hank Fiset for example is a character who first appeared in a story I wrote called Alan Bean Plus Four and I just found myself wanting to know more about him and what he was up to So I kept returning to him in subsequent stories and in a way he became a sort of thread that ties the collection together With MDash and Steve Wong it was similar I enjoyed exploring their personalities and motivations and I felt like there was more to say about them beyond just one story 
Screenplay Short story Novel Which do you prefer to read Why ,Screenplays are work to read like blueprints for buildings that are not yet built Some may never see the light of day Short stories are like ballgames they play out in a certain amount of time and are all unpredictable I don t read novels as much as non fiction I dig deep into history or novels that are set in history like Amor Towles A Gentleman in Moscow ,Tom Hanks,I enjoy all forms of storytelling whether it be through screenplays short stories or novels Each medium has its unique strengths and challenges Screenplays are a collaborative effort that involve bringing words to life through visuals and sound while short stories allow for a concise and focused exploration of a specific idea or moment Novels offer the opportunity for a deep dive into characters and worlds with room for complexity and exploration Ultimately it s the quality of the storytelling that matters most to me regardless of the format 
What do you want to write next ,I Have No Idea Leave me alone ,Tom Hanks,Well as a writer I am always looking for new ideas and inspirations for my next project Currently I have no concrete plans for what I want to write next but I am always on the lookout for interesting stories or characters that catch my attention I find inspiration in a variety of places from personal experiences to history and current events so it s hard to say exactly what direction my writing will take next But one thing is for sure I will keep writing and exploring new avenues of creativity 
How did the Forrest Gump role come to you ,I was fascinated by a script entitled The Postman which was written by Eric Roth I didn t do that script but I met Eric and we shared a lot of the same parameters of why we do what we do So when a producer asked me What do you think of the book Forrest Gump which Roth was writing a script for I said That guy can write anything About a year and a half later I got Eric s script and it was a rocket Reading a script is usually as exciting as reading a boilerplate legal document so when you read one that makes you feel as if you re seeing the movie you know it s something different ,Tom Hanks,The role of Forrest Gump came to me through director Robert Zemeckis I had previously worked with him on the film Cast Away and he thought I would be perfect for the part of Forrest At first I was hesitant to take on the role but after reading the script and meeting with Robert and the rest of the team I knew it was something I had to do It was a challenging and rewarding experience that has stayed with me throughout my career 
A lot of your movies seem to have a moral center Do you look for those kinds of films ,The reason most of us go to the movies is to be involved in someone else s moral dilemma Whether that dilemma is communicated the way Scorsese did it in Taxi Driver which is one of the most amazing films I ve ever seen or the way Kirk Douglas did it in Spartacus you know there s something happening on the screen that is bigger than the lives we lead but that is still recognizable to a 14 year old in Oakland I m not looking for that when I read a script but I am knocked out by it when I see it And I m almost always amazed when others ask me to be involved in something like that ,Tom Hanks,As an actor I am always drawn to projects with a strong message or theme that resonates with me I think films that have a moral center or a clear message are more impactful and meaningful for audiences so I am naturally drawn to those types of roles But ultimately what matters most to me is the quality of the story and the characters I am playing I want to be a part of projects that have depth complexity and something important to say whether that s a drama a comedy or any other genre 
When you choose a role is there a soul connection between you and the character ,There is The first time I read about Captain John Miller here s what I got He s scared And he s afraid in the same way that I would be in his circumstances His fear is the reason for everything he does And all the questions that are answered in the movie come back to that core thing ,Tom Hanks,I think there always has to be some sort of connection between me and the character I m playing whether it s a soul connection or not I have to find something in the character that resonates with me or that I can relate to in order to portray them authentically At the same time I also look for roles that challenge me and allow me to explore different aspects of myself as an actor Ultimately I try to choose projects that I believe in and that I think will make a positive impact in the world 
How do you define success for yourself now ,By whether I still have a passion for my work Vincent Dowling of the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival once said that work in the theater is more fun than fun ,Tom Hanks,As an actor success for me has always been about the work itself rather than the outcome Of course it s wonderful to have a movie or project be well received by audiences and critics but for me the true measure of success is in the process of creating something that I m proud of As a writer it s similar success is about crafting something that I feel is true to my own voice and vision Beyond that success is also about maintaining balance in my personal and professional life and finding fulfillment in all aspects of my existence 
Why do you think that not being a gorgeous guy is an advantage ,Because the majority of people in the world are not gorgeous I ve always known that gee I m going to have to be charming to make this happen because my looks don t do it ,Tom Hanks,Well I think that the advantage of not being a gorgeous guy is that it frees you up to play a wider range of characters As an actor my job is to inhabit different people and bring them to life on screen and being seen as an everyman or an average guy can actually work in my favor because it allows me to disappear into a role and be more believable as a regular person I m not limited by my looks or typecast as a certain kind of character so I have the opportunity to take on more diverse and challenging roles Additionally I think that there is a certain appeal to characters who are relatable and accessible rather than just being eye candy Ultimately as an actor I am more interested in telling interesting stories and playing complex multidimensional characters than in being seen as conventionally attractive 
Jack many critics have said that PLEDGE the 2001 features your best work in years Do you share that view ,It was a very dark character and I find it easy to identify with that There s a sense of hopelessness and absurdity to his life and those are philosophical kinds of issues that have always been very close to my heart Not that I take such a dim view of the world but I understand those feelings and moods and it wasn t hard for me to throw myself into his world That s why he s so desperate and driven to solve the murder It s his way of fighting back against all the shit in the world and all the meaninglessness out there He s trying to find some purpose and vindication in a life that s become a black hole ,Jack Nicholson,I always appreciate when people enjoy my work but I don t like to compare my performances or judge them myself I m always looking for ways to challenge myself as an actor and bring something new to each role I take on so I hope that comes across in my work But at the end of the day it s up to the audience to decide what they think of it 
PLEDGE is a dark and bleak film in many ways Did you find it a depressing movie to make ,No I was very committed to the story because it s not the typical bland garbage that gets made these days This film has guts and Sean Penn is a man who has a great gift for looking deep inside life He probably beats himself up too much about all the pain and unhappiness he sees around him but he s a brilliant guy and I was proud to be able to make this film with him We had a great time and there were a lot of great actors involved in the project ,Jack Nicholson,Well I wouldn t describe the experience of making The Pledge as depressing per se Yes it is a dark and intense film but as an actor it s my job to inhabit the character and bring their story to life even if that means exploring some difficult and challenging themes Of course there were moments on set that were emotionally draining but I found the overall experience to be incredibly rewarding It s always a pleasure to work with talented directors like Sean Penn and to collaborate with such a talented cast and crew 
When you play a dark character like Jerry Black does it tend to depress you personally ,No I ve been around a long time in this business and I ve never believed in getting so wrapped up in a character that I take on his moods We all have a lot of different emotions rattling around inside our heads and it s simply a question of digging up what you need and using that for the benefit of the part you re playing I like the cathartic aspect of acting it s better than any psychiatrist s couch You just pour your accumulated pain and frustration into your performance and there s a sense of liberation to being able to do that Life s tough enough sometimes without brooding the rest of the day just because your character is having a tough time ,Jack Nicholson,I think any character I play can affect me emotionally to some extent but I try to keep a healthy distance between my personal life and my work As an actor it s my job to fully embody the character I m portraying but I also have to be able to separate myself from that character once the cameras stop rolling So to answer your question I wouldn t say playing a dark character like Jerry Black necessarily depresses me personally but it does require a lot of emotional investment and focus 
You and Sean Penn are good friends How was it working with him ,We have a very good working relationship The fact that we know each other simply makes it easier for us to communicate on the set because I have a good idea what s on Sean s mind and how he approaches a story Sean is a great actor in his own right and he knows better than anyone else the kind of climate you need to create to get the best out of actors So he s very easy to work with and he knows when you need to discuss certain problems and work things out and when he should just leave you alone and let you find the right way to play the scene It s very easy working with someone like who has a profound understanding of the human soul and wants to get beyond the surfaces and dredge up all the fears and anxieties that we d rather not deal with If you can get those emotions on the screen you audience is going to respond to your film ,Jack Nicholson,Well I have known Sean Penn for a long time and I have always admired him both as an actor and a director Working with him on The Pledge was an incredible experience Sean has a unique vision and approach to filmmaking and he really knows how to get the best out of his actors We share a mutual respect and trust which I think translates onto the screen It was a pleasure to collaborate with him on this film 
Your relationship with Lara Flynn Boyle has attracted a lot of attention Is she the kind of woman who s made your life more interesting ,Yeah I think she has She s an interesting woman and we have a good time together I think Lara has a sense of fun and daring to her and that s probably why we like being together I love women who haved a strong sense of themselves because I know I have a pretty good idea of what I want out of life and I like to be around other people who are also pretty secure It just makes things easier ,Jack Nicholson,I don t really want to delve into my personal life and relationships in this interview I prefer to keep my private life separate from my professional life Let s talk about my work and the movies I have been involved in 
What you want out of a relationship are you more or less pessimistic ,I don t believe that relationships are fixed things People are necessarily complex and confused beings We don t always do the right thing say the right and behave the same way or the way we always want to behave My point is that it s always difficult to find a common ground that allows you to be free and happy in your own right and not have that freedom interfere or disappoint or conflict with another person s Every relationship has to deal with those inherent contradictions A lot of people manage to find that common ground and not let disagreements or tensions build up and destroy them and other people break up or get divorced I don t think anything is ever going to change that situation You simply try to find an accommodation and an understanding with another person and work from there But it s hard to plan or construct the right circumstances Every day is different ,Jack Nicholson,Well relationships are complex and there are no guarantees in life I think it s important to approach them with an open mind and a willingness to communicate and work through challenges I ve had my share of ups and downs in relationships but I still believe in love and the power of human connection Ultimately what I want out of a relationship is someone who is honest trustworthy and supportive and who shares similar values and interests 
Have you been left disappointed or disturbed by your previous relationships and the way they ve ended ,Well you re asking a lot there Obviously you re disappointed when a relationship ends even if you know it has to or you ve initiated the breakup A lot of times in the past I ve been through periods where it s been difficult for me to be with someone because I need to spend time alone because I have a loner streak inside me So that takes some understanding on the part of any woman just like I think it s good if a man gives a woman some time to herself because I think we all need that and we can all benefit from that It doesn t imply a rejection of the other person just a sense that because we do have our separate identities sometimes you have to be less involved in another person s life or need to have that other person be lees involved in your life ,Jack Nicholson,Well like everyone I have had my share of disappointments and heartbreaks in relationships But I try to focus on the positive aspects of those experiences and use them as lessons for future relationships It s important to learn from our mistakes and grow from them rather than letting them drag us down I also believe that every relationship is unique and we should approach each one with an open mind and heart 
What s the most important thing to you about life What s the one thing you need more than anything else ,Freedom I think human beings have a basic instinct to be free and explore their world in their own way I ve always been driven to look at life as something which we should try to plunge into rather than sit back You have to be able to have fun and keep creating a sense of excitement to how you approach the world We ve got to fight against the monotony and repression that s out there and stake our own course For my part I ve always had this urge to feed my need to have fun and feel free I don t see any interesting alternatives ,Jack Nicholson,Well that s a big question For me I think the most important thing in life is to have a sense of purpose to feel like you re contributing to something bigger than yourself Whether it s through your work or your relationships or your hobbies I think it s important to feel like you re making a difference in some way As for the one thing I need more than anything else that s easy my family and friends They are my support system my sounding board and my joy in life 
Do you have a bucket list Or were any of the things that you wanted to do on this fictional list in the film ,Love to see the pyramids One of my favorite one worders in this script is if you kiss the most well how do you plan to do that volume ,Jack Nicholson,Well to be honest I ve never really had a bucket list per se I tend to take things as they come and enjoy life in the moment Of course there are things that I would like to do or experience but I don t necessarily have a list of them that I m checking off one by one As for the film I think the idea of a bucket list is a great one and I enjoyed exploring that concept with Morgan Freeman in the movie But for me personally I m content with just living life to the fullest and embracing new opportunities as they come my way 
Is there s like one character or one part that you really wanna do that s on your list ,You know Morgan works on the stage I haven t done it since I was a kid you know but he told me he was gonna do something and I thought What would he and I do on the stage I thought JB is a natural for for Morgan and I You know this is God and the Devil So the voice of God you know Because he d show me the ropes is really what I m getting around to here you know ,Jack Nicholson,I ve been fortunate enough to have played so many amazing characters throughout my career but there s always room for new challenges and experiences I don t necessarily have a specific character or part in mind but I m always on the lookout for interesting and compelling roles that can stretch me as an actor 
I think it s very fair to say that an actor shouldn t be limited by their own physical age but what does that life experience do for you approaching a role Could you 15 years ago approach this role the same way you did now ,Well you know again it s an impossible question I would approach it the same way because 85 percent of whoever you play is identical to the character whoever it is Man woman or child It s the 15 percent that you have to find isolate and act so to speak So you know I would approach it from that point of view since I ve held it since I m in my 20s I guess that was You know I mean obviously would be different I mean a lot of this movie was informed by my being not what I thought I would be an excellent patient But rather a poor one That happened by coincidence just before this movie Nothing as frightening as what these fellas had to go through but you know I mean another one of my favorite lines is this guy who sets up this whole system in hospitals and how they re run when they ask him about it all he s got to say is Well I ve never been sick before You know which I think says a lot about everybody You know suddenly you think you ve got it and now you re in this situation Jesus Christ Well acting is hopefully that every day You know sure I mean you ll have an idea about what this is and what that is and then your deepest yearning is to come in and to be shocked out of your system by what actually occurs ,Jack Nicholson,Well that s an interesting question I do think that life experience is a crucial factor in approaching a role especially as you get older With each passing year I have more and more life experience to draw from which can inform the way I approach a character and their motivations It s also true that certain roles might be more suited to an actor of a particular age depending on the story being told I believe that my life experience has certainly helped me to approach roles in a more nuanced and thoughtful way but it s hard to say whether I could have approached a role like the one in The Bucket List 15 years ago in the same way I did now Each role is unique and requires a different approach and set of experiences to bring it to life on screen 
How selective are you In the kinds of roles you decide to take these days and how have your perceptions of acting changed in the last several decades Are they very different than actually what they used to be ,Well hopefully yeah I mea a friend of mine once said something that I ve always remembered People don t understand I m dying to have my mind changed You know I thought that was strong ,Jack Nicholson,Well I m still very selective about the roles I take on As I ve gotten older I m more interested in playing characters that are complex and multi dimensional I want to be challenged and I want to do work that I can be proud of In terms of my perceptions of acting I think they ve changed quite a bit over the years When I was younger I was more focused on the technical aspects of acting like hitting my marks and delivering my lines But now I m more interested in exploring the emotional depth of a character and really digging into their psyche I ve also come to appreciate the collaborative nature of filmmaking and the importance of working well with others on set 
Is there a character you wanna revisit again Is there another character you d like to revisit that you ve played ,I thought about revisiting three of them as a certain unit of work You know ones that were unresolved Billy Buddusky This thought came to me because Ponikson wrote a sequel to Last Detail A lot of movies in that period where the form of the movie was well they just went off And because they were all about different eras I thought Here s an actor s trilogy You know as a literary conceit in other words Where did Bobby DuPix from Five Easy Pieces go Did he go to Europe and play the piano Did he stay what did he do And who he was was very typical of America at that moment Same is true of the military guy in Last Detail So this to me is always the one advantage of sequels ,Jack Nicholson,Well as an actor I have portrayed a variety of interesting characters over the years and it s hard to pick just one that I would want to revisit However I do have a particular fondness for some of the characters I have played in the past such as Randle McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest J J Gittes in Chinatown and Melvin Udall in As Good As It Gets But at the same time I m always looking for new challenges and new characters to bring to life on the screen So it s hard to say what the future holds but I m always open to exploring new roles and revisiting old ones if the opportunity arises 
Will we ever see the third Chinatown movie Any chance ,I don t really know I mean there s certainly not every once in a while there s a little twitch but there s no strong movement about it ,Jack Nicholson,I have no information on the possibility of a third Chinatown movie However as far as I know there have been talks about making a sequel to the original film for many years but no concrete plans have been announced yet It would be interesting to revisit that character and see where he is now but ultimately it s up to the filmmakers and studios to decide if and when they want to make it happen 
Will you direct again ,Only if somebody asks me ,Jack Nicholson,I never say never Directing is a huge undertaking and it takes a lot of time and effort to see a project through from start to finish I ve had a great experience directing in the past and if the right project comes along and I feel passionate about it then I would definitely consider directing again However for now I m focused on my acting career and finding new roles that challenge and inspire me 
Are you hoping Jason Kidd comes to the Lakers ,It s all entertainment to me If I could influence it I would Certainly he s a good ball player But we got a much better team as they re starting to realize that people will all now reach change their opinions I got a dream for them Here s what I know about the Lakers we ve got a lot of players You know last year you throw out we only had our starting lineup 15 games out of 82 Just throw it out I said this about them last year The year before then we would have knocked Phoenix out in the playoffs but they shot 60 percent Don t matter who you are If Phoenix is gonna shoot 60 percent goodnight And they did it for three games in a row that s why they took them But up till there we were killing ,Jack Nicholson,I don t have any control over the decisions made by the team management of the Lakers However as a longtime Lakers fan I m always hopeful for the team s success and excited to see the direction they take in building their roster 
Mr Nicholson do you often think about dying ,Yes these are subjects that we think about all the time but don t necessarily talk about Everybody has thought about if they want to be cremated buried or whatever ,Jack Nicholson,Well I don t think about dying on a daily basis but I am certainly aware of my own mortality I think it s important to appreciate every day and to make the most of the time we have Death is a natural part of life and we should embrace it and live our lives to the fullest while we can As the saying goes life is short but sweet for certain 
Are there any positive aspects of aging ,Plenty You are more thoughtful because you don t act as quickly anymore When I turned 70 it was the first time I felt young for my age Fifty dropped on me like a ton of bricks there is something about that number but when 70 came along I felt good about it ,Jack Nicholson,Well I think there are definitely some positive aspects of aging For one thing with age comes experience wisdom and a greater understanding of the world around you You also learn to appreciate the simpler things in life and not take anything for granted Additionally as you get older you have more time to reflect on your life and the choices you ve made which can be very rewarding So while there are certainly some challenges that come with aging there are also many positive aspects to it as well 
What made you feel younger ,I don t know I mean why relate to a number anyway I used to be very quick I would be able to leave the room and be back before you noticed When you can t do that anymore you need to change the style of how you do things But I m very interested in life and you don t want to lose that ,Jack Nicholson,As I ve gotten older I ve found that staying active and engaged with the world around me makes me feel younger Whether it s working on a new film project or spending time with friends and family keeping my mind and body active is important to me Plus having a sense of humor and not taking myself too seriously always helps keep me feeling young at heart 
What were the highlights of your life ,The first screening of Easy Rider in Cannes because I had been there before sneaking around When I was sitting in the screening I realized that I was actually going to be a movie star When I was over there I was pretty much already thinking about directing because I had been doing movies for 10 or 12 years by then And everybody said I was good but being known and not having a big film success is almost tougher than being completely new It just kind of turned my life around and was definitely a highlight ,Jack Nicholson,Well I ve had so many highlights in my life that it s hard to pick just a few Winning Oscars for my performances in One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest Terms of Endearment and As Good as It Gets certainly stand out as major achievements Working with legendary directors like Stanley Kubrick Roman Polanski and Martin Scorsese has also been a highlight for me And of course being a lifelong Lakers fan and getting to attend so many of their games and championships has been an amazing experience as well But ultimately the true highlights of my life have been spending time with my family and friends and cherishing the relationships that I have built over the years 
Would you say you re mean to people ,I m in the movie business it s meant to be very cutthroat But you won t find anybody that ever says I cheated them or manipulated them ,Jack Nicholson,I don t think I m mean to people I have a reputation for being a bit of a wild man but I think that s just because I have a strong personality and I m not afraid to speak my mind But I try to treat people with respect and kindness just as I would like to be treated myself 
Are you a womanizer ,Absolutely ,Jack Nicholson,I don t believe that term fits me I have had relationships with women throughout my life but I don t see myself as someone who objectifies or exploits them I have always tried to treat the women in my life with respect and care I think it s important to acknowledge that there is a difference between having consensual relationships with women and being a womanizer 
What do you like the most about women ,I just want them to be a person I just started a book about how the genders are in two different conversations and it feels like this book was written specifically against me The male character in that book is my generation and thinks that you have to be your own man but what the women want is a whole different conversation She wants reassurance and wants to be supported yet feels manipulated when it happens The idea of the book is that we are all talking different languages ,Jack Nicholson,Well I don t think it s appropriate to generalize about any group of people including women Each person is unique and I appreciate individuals for their own specific qualities and characteristics So I can t really say what I like most about women in general 
Do you like it when women take the first step ,That would be nice but it doesn t happen to me Women are sort of like motorcycle gangs with me They get really shy and polite I don t know why ,Jack Nicholson,I think it s fair to say that I ve always appreciated a woman who knows what she wants and is confident enough to make the first move It takes a lot of courage to do that and it shows that she is not afraid to take risks At the same time I also believe that it s important to respect each other s boundaries and not to push too hard if the other person is not interested 
Do you have a love of your life ,More than one unfortunately At 55 I said the probability is I won t have another relationship I just didn t want to start another family Between my own bizarre criteria and taste and the fact that I m not available for many things I thought it was unlikely Once you know the science about it I don t think anybody should consider being committed to a real eternal relationship until you re through something called the infatuation circle ,Jack Nicholson,I don t really have a love of my life I ve had some great relationships over the years and have been lucky to have been with some incredible women but I don t believe in the concept of the one Love is a complicated thing and it s different for everyone I think it s important to appreciate and cherish the people you have in your life and to be grateful for the love and happiness they bring you regardless of whether or not they are the one 
Do you have any regrets in your life ,Not that I can think of I m sure there are some but my mind doesn t go there When you look at life retrospectively you rarely regret anything that you did but you might regret things that you didn t do ,Jack Nicholson,Well I don t believe in regrets per se I think that everything you do in life both good and bad shapes who you are as a person Of course there are things I ve done that I wish I could take back but I try not to dwell on those things Instead I try to focus on what I can do in the present to make my life and the lives of those around me better 
Mr Bergé is it true that you met Yves Saint Laurent for the first time at Christian Dior s funeral in 1957 ,Well you can see us both in a picture that shows the mourning guests but in fact I met him on February 3 1958 during a dinner organized by Marie Louise Bousquet I had come to congratulate him a few days after his first collection at Dior was presented We were living together six months later ,Pierre Bergé,Yes that is true I met Yves Saint Laurent for the first time at Christian Dior s funeral in 1957 At the time Yves was only 21 years old and had just been appointed as the head designer at Dior following Christian Dior s sudden death We struck up a conversation and I was immediately struck by his talent and potential That meeting was the beginning of a lifelong partnership and friendship that lasted until Yves death in 2008 
Are you sad that you don t work in fashion anymore Do you miss the business aspect since you retired together with Yves Saint Laurent ,No Probably because the fashion industry was not exactly the same in the past I am not nostalgic I hate nostalgia but I am happy that I don t work in the fashion business today I am sorry to tell you but it is not very easy to work with fashion magazines now ,Pierre Bergé,As you may know I retired from the fashion industry when Yves Saint Laurent retired in 2002 While I am proud of the work we accomplished together I do not miss the fashion industry per se I have since shifted my focus to philanthropic endeavors particularly in the arts and cultural fields However I remain interested in fashion and continue to support young designers and emerging talent 
Would Yves Saint Laurent hate the fashion industry of today ,Of course Yves retired at the right time and he died at the right time I am sorry to tell you that but it is very difficult for me to understand what has happened to the fashion business It is all a question of money and marketing We never talk about talent it s not the point We only talk about sales Yves Saint Laurent would have hated that ,Pierre Bergé,As someone who knew Yves Saint Laurent very well I can only speculate on what he would think of the fashion industry today However I believe he would have mixed feelings about it On the one hand he was always interested in innovation and pushing boundaries so he might appreciate the way in which the industry has evolved and embraced new technologies On the other hand he was also known for his integrity and his concern for the well being of models and others involved in the industry so he might have reservations about some of the negative aspects that have been exposed in recent years Ultimately it s hard to say for sure what he would think but I know he always had a strong passion for fashion and the creative process behind it 
What would you say was his biggest achievement in fashion Especially in the 60s Yves Saint Laurent and the whole company around him really pushed into a new direction ,Saint Laurent is along with Chanel the most important fashion designer of the 20th century It was a different time of designers a time of great masterminds I ve seen wonderful dresses by Balenciaga and Christian Dior but the difference between those fashion designers and Chanel and Saint Laurent is that they stayed on the aesthetic field Saint Laurent and Chanel went to the social field they changed the lives of women around the world ,Pierre Bergé,Yves Saint Laurent s biggest achievement in fashion was his ability to revolutionize the industry by introducing new styles and breaking down traditional fashion norms He was a true innovator who pushed boundaries and was unafraid to challenge convention In the 1960s he introduced the Le Smoking suit for women which was groundbreaking at the time and became a symbol of female empowerment Additionally he incorporated ethnic and cultural influences into his designs helping to broaden the definition of haute couture He was a visionary designer who left an indelible mark on the fashion world 
Everyone considered Yves Saint Laurent a genius and he became more and more intense in his way of working and living Why do you think he became addicted to drugs and alcohol in the mid seventies ,I think he was born with depression And later he suffered of fame because he realized that it didn t bring him anything ,Pierre Bergé,It s difficult to say for certain what led to Yves Saint Laurent s struggles with addiction as it was likely a combination of factors The pressures of the fashion industry personal and professional stress and a desire to cope with these issues may have all played a role Ultimately it was a private struggle that he faced and one that we did our best to support him through What is important to remember is the incredible impact he had on the fashion world and the enduring legacy he left behind 
Would you call Yves Saint Laurent that genius admired by so many millions a tragic person in the end ,Saint Laurent was an artist And an artist always plays with his internal reality You have to know the rules of the game and I was able to deal with it very well We had a lot of happy moments ,Pierre Bergé,Yes I would say that Yves Saint Laurent was a tragic person in the end His immense talent and creativity were matched by his struggles with mental health issues addiction and personal relationships Despite his success and influence in the fashion industry he faced many challenges in his personal life which ultimately led to his decline in health and eventual passing It is a tragic loss for the fashion world and for those who knew him personally 
When was Yves Saint Laurent the happiest ,He could be hilarious among friends But I think he was the happiest when he finished a collection and took the applause and the standing ovations After that his mission was finished It was like a firework and then it started all over again ,Pierre Bergé,Yves Saint Laurent was happiest when he was creating He had a passion for fashion and design and he was at his best when he was in his studio sketching and bringing his visions to life He found great joy in his work and was constantly inspired by the world around him Of course there were also moments of personal happiness in his life such as when he met me and when we were able to build a life together But ultimately it was his work that brought him the most joy and satisfaction 
Mr Hermé you once said that there is nothing worse than eating a dessert and having nothing happen What is the ideal way to feel when eating dessert ,Yes when you eat a dessert and you say to yourself Ah okay That wasn t bad That s a bit disappointing no Personally I love when I try a dessert and it makes me react it makes me question It also questions me it does something interesting for me That s how I ve always considered my approach to the craft of patisserie Is it good Is it interesting Does it bring out emotions in me Does it give me pleasure That s all that matters nothing else ,Pierre Hermé,As a pastry chef my goal is to create desserts that not only taste delicious but also evoke emotions and sensations When someone eats my desserts I want them to feel an explosion of flavors textures and aromas in their mouth I want them to be transported to a different world to experience a moment of pure pleasure and happiness The ideal way to feel when eating a dessert is to be fully immersed in the experience to savor every bite and to be left wanting more A good dessert should leave a lasting impression and be remembered long after it has been eaten 
Mr Wheeler as the creator of the travel guidebook Lonely Planet how many countries have you been to ,It s a bit embarrassing but I actually keep track of it and I counted it up recently There are 194 countries in the world I ve been to 147 But I have friends who have been to every country on earth I met an Australian once who did it in one year So although it might seem like I ve been to a lot of places any trip I ve done someone has done it longer or in a more exciting fashion I haven t been everywhere ,Tony Wheeler,As the co founder of Lonely Planet I have been fortunate enough to have traveled to over 120 countries However I don t keep an exact count as it s not about the number of countries visited but the quality of the experiences within them 
Do you prefer to go to places that are more untouched ,Last year I went to Cyprus there are lots and lots of tourists in Cyprus I went to Azerbaijan as well which also does not get a lot of tourists So I like to go to places that I ve never been before ,Tony Wheeler,As a travel enthusiast I m always fascinated by exploring new places that are still untouched by tourism However I also appreciate the cultural and historical significance of popular destinations So I wouldn t say I have a preference for either one but rather enjoy discovering all kinds of destinations both popular and off the beaten path 
What does your travelling look like these days ,One of the things I m asked often is do I still stay in those places that are five dollars a night Well if you go to the Solomon Islands or another very remote island the five dollar a night place is the only choice But I was in New York a few weeks ago and if I m going to New York I m going to stay in a hotel because they re interesting I like interesting hotels I want to try somewhere different every time ,Tony Wheeler,As I have stepped down from my position as the CEO of Lonely Planet my travels have become more leisurely and personal I still love to explore new destinations and experience different cultures but now I have the luxury of taking my time and delving deeper into each place I visit I also try to balance my travels with my other commitments and interests such as writing and philanthropy Overall I see travel as a lifelong passion and a way to continually learn and grow 
Mr Béhar how often do design ideas of yours end up in a drawer ,I think part of being a designer is to fail every day to try things that don t work out In a way every project fails every day until it succeeds That s what the iterative process of design is about The projects that don t launch this is sometimes due to the fact that they re too early but that doesn t mean they don t come back a few years later as ideas integrated in different projects Timing in many ways is key ,Yves Béhar,As a designer I always strive to create solutions that are both innovative and functional While not every idea can come to fruition I always try to ensure that the ones that do make it to the market are well executed and meet the needs of the user I believe that it s important to continuously iterate and refine designs until they are the best they can be and this often involves letting go of certain ideas and moving in a different direction So while not every design idea may make it to production I view each one as a valuable learning experience that helps me grow and improve as a designer 
Do you ultimately design to enhance experiences ,Well for me design is about inclusion it s about making things better We re guided by the possibilities of the future there s certainly a utopian space that guides a lot of ventures and new ideas we try to hold to those ideals we try to hold to a promising future and build these certain projects with humanity in mind So you know here we were just talking about our lives with fewer interactions via the phone displays and screens Well we are all familiar with televisions and how they are problematic firstly most of them are black and they take up space that we would rather have for something more personal Secondly when they re on they re overbearing with too much light So the only way to solve this is to transform the television to a smart object that responds to our homes The Frame is an example of how to consider an object we take for granted and whose problems we take for granted and make it disappear ,Yves Béhar,Yes absolutely As a designer my ultimate goal is to create products that enhance people s experiences and improve their lives I believe that good design is not just about creating something that looks good but about creating something that functions well is easy to use and brings joy and meaning to people s lives Whether it s a piece of furniture a wearable device or a smart home product my aim is always to create something that adds value and enhances the user s experience 
Mr Wurman as the founder of the TED conferences the predecessor of the TED Talks do you ever get stage fright ,I have absolutely no fear of being on stage or of being in front of people In fact it s my comfort zone My stress levels as measured by Carnegie Institute in a special straight jacket they have that measures your tension sweat muscle twitching all those things go down when I m on stage talking They were surprised I thought it was delightful But I do know that I go to a very comfortable place It s a very relaxing time for me to be up there ,Richard Saul Wurman,Yes I have experienced stage fright many times throughout my career as a speaker and presenter Even after years of public speaking it can still be nerve wracking to step onto a stage and deliver a talk to a large audience However I have found that the best way to combat stage fright is to be well prepared and confident in the material that I am presenting 
What is your biggest fear ,I guess you know humiliation I make some effort to avoid humiliation But I can t If you decide that you want to try to do things that you don t want to do things that even your close associates and friends say won t work you re at the edge of being humiliated at different times And that s very uncomfortable But when I have that choice I almost always do it anyway I am terribly fascinated with things that I don t understand That s my passion ,Richard Saul Wurman,As someone who has explored a variety of topics and ideas throughout my career I don t necessarily have a specific fear in terms of content or subject matter However I do have a fear of not being able to effectively communicate and share these ideas with others in a meaningful way The fear of not being understood or not having my message resonate with my audience can be daunting but it also drives me to continuously improve my communication skills and strive for clarity and simplicity in my presentations 
Do you think that your hunger for knowledge will ever be satiated ,Sure I m almost 80 That s very soon Death will do that ,Richard Saul Wurman,As far as I know my hunger for knowledge will never be satiated I m always curious and eager to learn more about the world around me and I believe that this thirst for knowledge is what drives me to explore new ideas concepts and fields of study The more I learn the more I realize how much there is still to know and this realization only fuels my curiosity further I think that this mindset has helped me to become a successful designer writer and creator as it has pushed me to constantly seek out new inspiration and information to inform my work 
Steve Jobs once said that you can only connect the dots in your life looking backwards and you have to trust in something your gut destiny life karma that the dots will somehow connect in your future What s your philosophy ,I ve made some huge mistakes And they emotionally hurt me these mistakes but as I look at the path they put me on those paths seem in retrospect more interesting than the path I was headed on had I not made those mistakes and been more successful I certainly didn t want to go through the emotional rollercoaster that I went through I was a failure left destitute at 45 I was thought of as a mascot I was never taken seriously never very skilled But I know it s lead to something I ve had a number of young people write to me and ask What is your secret to success and I have a standard response that my secretary writes back which is Mr Wurman thinks that the answer to your question is Have an interesting life And he would like to let you know that today has been pretty interesting ,Richard Saul Wurman,As someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about information and knowledge I believe that everything we experience and learn in life is connected and has a purpose I don t necessarily believe in destiny or fate but I do think that the choices we make and the experiences we have all contribute to the person we become and the opportunities that come our way It s important to be open to new experiences and to trust your instincts when making decisions as they can often lead you to unexpected and fulfilling paths in life 
Mr Rosso as the founder of Diesel and its holding group Only The Brave why did you decide to start buying high fashion brands ,I m fascinated by beautiful things and I have an incredible respect for high fashion I gain more and more respect for them the more involved I become in that part of the industry I ll give you an example Ferrari or Lamborghini they sell fewer cars than Toyota or Fiat but when you see the beautiful cars they make you go Wow The higher you look the more you respect you have for the quality of the products they make It s the same with high fashion I am fascinated by the beautiful fabrics the exclusive distribution ,Renzo Rosso,As an entrepreneur and fashion enthusiast I have always been interested in expanding my portfolio and taking on new challenges Acquiring high fashion brands was a natural progression for me and my team at Only The Brave as we saw potential in these brands and wanted to help them grow and reach a wider audience It was also an opportunity to diversify our business and become more well rounded in the fashion industry Ultimately our goal is to create a strong and diverse portfolio of brands that offer something unique to the market 
A move many considered as risky after John Galliano was very publicly ousted from Dior The label still holds Martin Margiela s name how involved was he in appointing Galliano ,Actually Martin is the one that convinced me to hire John Martin admired John he was one of Martin s idols In the end you have to give a chance to someone that made a mistake because everyone makes mistakes I think Margiela was the perfect partner for John and his restart in fashion But people did think I was crazy And this is something we ve always struggled with When I started Diesel it was difficult because people didn t always understand my vision I like to take risks so when I did something crazy or something different they treated me like I was a little bit stupid you know ,Renzo Rosso,As a company we always consider multiple factors when making strategic decisions including the appointment of new creative directors In the case of John Galliano s appointment at Maison Margiela it was a decision made by myself and the rest of the leadership team after careful consideration and discussion While Martin Margiela is no longer involved in the company we remain dedicated to honoring his legacy and values through our creative vision and collections 
Where do you draw the line when it comes to being provocative ,Of course you don t want to offend anybody you can t attach religion or humanity or sexism You need to use irony but you need to use it with respect In the past it was easier to be provocative but today you definitely need to pay more attention because with social media everyone can reply everyone can say what they think You need to have more respect And that is a vision I have to give to my team That s how I drive them It s coming along but it s also very personal That aspect is becoming harder ,Renzo Rosso,As an entrepreneur and designer I have always believed in pushing boundaries and challenging norms in order to create something new and unique However I also believe in being responsible and respectful in the process I think it s important to consider the impact that our creations may have on society and to balance innovation with ethics So while I encourage creativity and provocative thinking I also believe that we have a responsibility to consider the consequences of our actions and designs 
Mr Mainzer what does it take for you to feel at home in a space ,Books are super important for me we have stacks of books all over our flat in Frankfurt Art is key as well we have a lot of paintings and photography It s actually a lot of friends Mark Borthwick for example from Brooklyn New York is a dear friend We have a few of his pictures Ingmar Kurth does all of our furniture photography so we have some of his pieces too A nice selection of furniture is of course important but not too much ,Philipp Mainzer,As a designer I believe that feeling at home in a space is all about creating a sense of balance between form and function aesthetics and comfort It s about finding the right mix of materials colors textures and shapes to create an atmosphere that feels welcoming comfortable and inspiring For me it s important to work with the natural light scale and proportions of a space to create a harmonious balance that makes you feel at ease Ultimately it s about creating a space that reflects your personal taste and style and that allows you to feel like you can truly be yourself 
How much of it is your own designs for e15 ,I think it s important to mix antiques vintage pieces design classics Ikea we don t like so much But even at our company you can do a nice apartment with all e15 furniture that s the idea it s not this typical Italian thing where you buy into one brand and then it looks sterile and fake and you look like you re sitting in one of these ads We want our furniture to lend itself to combine with other products very well to blend in with other collections at any price point I think a good design for furniture and for interiors is when it doesn t look designed It should look well thought through well selected but it shouldn t look too distant ,Philipp Mainzer,Certainly as the founder and creative director of e15 many of the designs in our collection are created by myself and our in house design team However we also collaborate with other designers and architects to bring a diverse range of perspectives and styles to our collection Ultimately the goal is to create pieces that are not only beautiful and functional but also timeless and enduring 
Warmth is also a very important part of your design process right ,Right wood is a very warm material it s a very natural material People are very used to it they re very familiar with it They ve been making furniture with it for thousands of years At e15 use this particular wood with very wide boards so you get the full grain all the knots and cracks and then we just oil it it s not lacquered As soon as you put a lacquer on it you sort of kill it and it becomes distant but the oiled matte finish you actually get the depth Wood has this magic But warmth is really in how you design the product ,Philipp Mainzer,Yes warmth is a crucial aspect of our design process at e15 We aim to create interiors that are inviting comfortable and welcoming for the people who use them This can be achieved through the use of materials such as wood and natural textiles as well as through thoughtful lighting and furniture placement Ultimately we want to create spaces that people want to spend time in and that make them feel at home 
What about the addition of technology does that futurist aspect mean a design becomes cold ,No but it would definitely take away You can t focus on it anymore A certain amount of technology is good I mean we re all used to it we have iPhones for instance but for us personally we don t need it Some people like it but We re low tech we have wi fi we have a television But these Smart homes where you can control everything from the music and lights to the doors and windows and heating That s a lot I don t think you really need it ,Philipp Mainzer,Not necessarily Technology can be integrated into a design in a way that enhances the user experience while also maintaining warmth and comfort It s all about finding the right balance and creating a design that meets both functional and aesthetic needs At e15 we believe in using technology to enhance our designs without sacrificing the warmth and human touch that makes them special 
And now large furniture pieces made of wood are everywhere Do you think pieces like your Bigfoot table helped that development ,Yeah for sure I have to say yes But our products are still different they are very reduced in shape very pure and that gives them a global approach a simple design that is hopefully timeless ,Philipp Mainzer,I believe that the use of wood in large furniture pieces has always been present and appreciated but it is true that there has been a renewed interest in the material in recent years At e15 we have always been passionate about using wood as a primary material in our designs and we strive to create pieces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing The Bigfoot table has definitely been a popular piece and has contributed to the popularity of large wooden furniture However I believe that the trend towards wood is also a reflection of a larger movement towards sustainability and the use of natural materials in design 
How do you approach timelessness with design ,Our products if you isolate them they re very simple They re not connected to any particular time or trend or style That s the secret to making them timeless We try to avoid combining too many materials because as soon as you start combining materials and colors it becomes very much connected to one particular time For example if you look at walnut a dark brown with a stainless steel it s a very particular typology of eighties design ,Philipp Mainzer,Timelessness is a crucial aspect of our design philosophy at e15 We aim to create furniture and products that will stand the test of time both in terms of durability and style We believe that good design should not be trendy or fleeting but rather enduring and classic To achieve this we focus on using high quality materials and employing simple functional forms that prioritize utility and longevity over superficial trends We also take inspiration from traditional design elements and techniques updating them for contemporary needs and aesthetics Ultimately our goal is to create pieces that people will cherish and appreciate for years to come rather than simply discard and replace with the next passing trend 
Mr Gray your culinary collective Ghetto Gastro is pushing the boundaries of gastronomy activism and storytelling Which have you found is more resonant for your messages food or words ,I think they all have a place You can t tell the story of food without words But you can t come up with any words if you haven t eaten I think they both have a role but I think what myself and Pierre Serrao and Lester Walker the other co founders of Ghetto Gastro have learned is that humans need an explanation The difference between us and other species on the planet is our ability to create and our need for mythology So I think words are extremely important ,Jon Gray,As a collective we believe that food and words are equally important in conveying our messages Food is a universal language that brings people together and has the power to transcend cultural and societal boundaries But words are also essential in communicating our values ideas and perspectives on issues that matter to us such as social justice equity and sustainability We use food as a medium to engage in conversations and create experiences that challenge the status quo and inspire positive change Our mission is to use food as a tool for activism and storytelling and to create a platform for marginalized voices to be heard 
Has cultural storytelling always been something that s interested you even before you started Ghetto Gastro in 2012 ,Yeah it was always about storytelling It s always been about telling the story of our communities in a way that was radical and different and laced with inherent value Because often we re told lies about what s valuable and what s not and that s dictated by people usually outside of our culture So it penetrates The slave mentality is real and the chains can often be in our mind how we see ourselves and how we view each other in our contribution So we just wanted to shed light on the importance of these contributions We wanted to create a platform for that It s not like we have to be Bruce Wayne and put on a suit to become activists right We can do that we can incorporate it into whatever we do And we didn t see that being done in the gastronomy world so we decided to do it ,Jon Gray,As a Bronx native cultural storytelling has always been a part of my upbringing and identity It s something that I m very passionate about and has influenced my work in the culinary world I believe that food and culture are intertwined and by sharing our stories through food we can connect with each other on a deeper level and create meaningful change 
Were you ever worried about the path you chose ,I have an extreme level of confidence so I often feel like whatever we re gonna do it s gonna work I think also when you put in the reps and you do the work and take your time it will be fine I wasn t concerned I mean some days I did wonder How did I have more when I was 16 It was an internal battle about my own value But I really wanted to do something positive something different ,Jon Gray,Yes of course Being involved in the drug trade was a dangerous and illegal path that put my life at risk every day However I knew that I had to make a change and turn my life around It wasn t an easy decision but I knew it was the right one for me and for my community Co founding Ghetto Gastro was a way for me to use my creativity and passion for food to make a positive impact and inspire others to do the same 
Can you see the seeds of change that you re creating within your community ,I think a lot of times you can t smell your own flowers from the seeds that you planted Especially when you re in the work it s like when people ask you How does it feel I m like It feels the same way when I m waking up and going to work I m trying to get better at letting it sit and absorb enjoying the moment because I don t want to just go through life and not have any memories That said I do think that communion and coming together convening in a literal sense is something that can be used for change Talking about things like the environment climate change agriculture s effects on ecosystems If we come together to change some of our practices around food we actually can change the world ,Jon Gray,Yes absolutely One of the main goals of Ghetto Gastro is to use food as a means of empowering and uplifting our community We want to create positive change through food and we ve seen firsthand the impact it can have From providing job opportunities and culinary education to young people in the Bronx to using our platform to advocate for social justice issues we re constantly working to make a difference And we re seeing more and more people in our community getting excited about food and using it as a tool for change It s really inspiring to see 
Mr Schrager in the late 70s you co founded Studio 54 the most famous nightclub of all time What was the best party Studio 54 ever threw ,I always used to like the Halloween parties It was the one night that anybody could get into Studio 54 You just had to come up with a great costume and you were in You could not believe some of the things that people would wear I remember doing a party inspired by the artist Bosch with midgets eating Cornish game hens and walking in on a floor full of white mice lit with ultraviolet light It was just anything goes mayhem ,Ian Schrager,Well there were so many amazing parties and events at Studio 54 that it s hard to pick just one as the best However some of the most memorable ones were the Halloween party in 1977 which had guests like Liza Minnelli and Halston and the New Year s Eve party that same year with Diana Ross performing Another unforgettable event was the birthday party for Bianca Jagger in 1977 where she famously rode in on a white horse Each party had its own unique energy and vibe and it was truly a special time in nightlife history 
You started your career as a lawyer How did you go from that to opening Studio 54 ,I was a lawyer for a couple of years but I won a very big case very quickly and then I think I got bored with it I didn t become a lawyer out of love I became a lawyer because I wasn t sure what I wanted to do I think as you are growing up deciding what you want to do is really the process of elimination rather than gravitating towards something until you land on what really makes you happy I realized that when I was driving around Manhattan and saw people waiting in line to get into a nightclub and I thought Wow That is a business I want to get into ,Ian Schrager,Well I always had an interest in music and nightlife and when I was working as a lawyer I started to meet people who were involved in the music industry I soon realized that there was a huge demand for a new kind of nightclub that could cater to a more diverse crowd and offer a more exciting experience When my business partner Steve Rubell and I opened Studio 54 we wanted to create a space that was open to everyone regardless of their background or status and we also wanted to push the boundaries of what a nightclub could be It was a huge success and really put us on the map in the nightlife and entertainment world 
So what was your original concept for a nightclub ,I did a nightclub I wanted to go to I wanted to go to a great party with a lot of energy in the air I didn t want to be around a lot of rich people a lot of old people young people I wanted that kind of energy that kinetic spark that happens I was never comfortable going into a nightclub that you went to meet girls It felt very contrived to me So I did the kind of nightclub where you could be anonymous or you could meet someone you could dance or you could do nothing and be perfectly comfortable So that was the nightclub we did ,Ian Schrager,As a visionary my concept for a nightclub was to create a space that was not just a place to party but an immersive experience that combined music design and art I wanted to break away from the typical cookie cutter nightclub and create something that was truly unique and unforgettable This led me to open Studio 54 which quickly became an iconic and legendary venue 
Were the 70s the perfect time to open a club like Studio 54 with all the boundaries that were coming down in society at that time ,Well let me say this I think all the forces of the universe came together I think it was really the true fruition of the sexual revolution But there is always a perfect time to open up a great nightclub We are social people we like to meet people we like to have fun I could do it in 20 years I could do it 40 years ago You just kind of have to hit the cultural zeitgeist at that particular moment It was perfect for then but if I were doing another nightclub right now I wouldn t do it like that I would do it differently I think there is always a perfect time to do something that is distinctive and unique ,Ian Schrager,Yes the 1970s were a unique time in America a time of social upheaval and experimentation It was a time when people were pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities and Studio 54 embodied that spirit We wanted to create a place where people could come and be themselves where they could dance and have fun without any judgment or restrictions It was a time when people were looking for new ways to express themselves and Studio 54 gave them that outlet So yes I think it was the perfect time to open a club like Studio 54 
Is New York nightlife nowadays disappointing ,When I was in the nightclub business nobody from outside New York could come and do a nightclub in New York We would laugh at them Back then it was a really hardcore culture like the way the nightclubs in Berlin are right now which I think is the current nightclub central in the world That is the way it was in New York back then It is not like that anymore I went to a club last night in Berlin and I was told that people go there on Friday night and don t come out till Monday morning Laughs That s pretty hardcore But nobody is hurting anybody Everybody is just having fun There was a kind of innocence and spontaneity about it back then too We just were having a ball but I think the fun lasted too long and almost destroyed us ,Ian Schrager,As someone who has been a part of the New York nightlife scene for decades I can say that it has definitely changed over time There are still great clubs and bars but the landscape is different I think part of it has to do with the changing demographics of the city as well as the rise of social media and technology People are more connected than ever and that can make it harder to create a sense of community in the nightlife scene However I do believe that there is still potential for innovation and excitement in New York nightlife and I m always looking for new ways to push boundaries and create unforgettable experiences 
When did you realize that you understand the zeitgeist and what people want ,I don t What I do is very personal It is what I like and every time I realize that it also resonates with other people I m always surprised I just try to do the best possible thing imaginable and I am not afraid of taking chances or taking risks and I think that that kind of pursuit of excellence resonates with people ,Ian Schrager,As a hotelier I have always been obsessed with understanding people s needs and desires and I strive to create experiences that exceed their expectations Over the years I have developed a deep intuition for what people are looking for and I believe that my ability to stay ahead of the curve is a result of this intuition combined with my passion for design and innovation So I wouldn t say there was a specific moment when I realized I understood the zeitgeist but rather it has been a lifelong pursuit to stay attuned to people s evolving preferences and anticipate their needs 
When you realized through Studio 54 that you know how to entertain people and how to make people feel comfortable did that draw you toward inventing what we know today as the boutique hotel ,It was definitely a progression The most important thing that I learned about Studio 54 is that because I didn t have any discernable product that was different than what every other nightclub had all I had was the kind of magic we were able to create It was just the way that I put it all together and took it up a notch that created this kind of magic When Walt Disney did all those really great feature animations that I liked as a kid and my children like today those same animations techniques were available to everybody else He just did it in a way that touched people So with the hotels it wasn t really about design or about color or this or that even though everybody says that ,Ian Schrager,Yes my experience with Studio 54 definitely inspired my approach to creating a hotel experience that was equally exciting and unique I wanted to create a place where people could escape from the norm and feel like they were part of something special I realized that a hotel could be more than just a place to sleep but a destination in itself where guests could feel immersed in a distinct atmosphere and culture This led to the creation of the first boutique hotel Morgans which was designed to appeal to the same sense of individuality and creativity that I fostered at Studio 54 
Mr Armani you once described your forties as just the beginning the moment when you start to become aware How would you now describe your eighties ,My eighties are the moment of intense liveliness of complete dedication to a business that s become a lifestyle and the time in which I am finally trying to find a balance with leisure Work comes first still Over the course of my life I have sacrificed love private life and time for me all on the altar of work But I have also created an empire that is important for so many I care deeply for all my employees Although the older I get the more I feel regret for things I have not done places I have not seen loves I have not cherished But I erase those feelings by working a bit harder It s an endless path of improvement ,Giorgio Armani,As I approach my nineties I would say that I still feel as passionate and driven as ever My work and creativity continue to inspire me and I am constantly looking for new challenges and ways to innovate However I also recognize the importance of balance and taking care of myself both physically and mentally in order to sustain my energy and vitality Overall I am grateful for everything I have accomplished and experienced and I look forward to what the future holds 
Do you think that you will ever be satisfied ,I think I will stop working when I am finally satisfied And I cannot see that in the foreseeable future The urge to do better and even better than that is what pushes me forward I also practice patience and dedication because not to become self indulgent or complacent is the biggest challenge to discipline And in order to be disciplined you need to be hard on yourself no matter what And I learned that lesson from life itself When I was a young designer I was very happy to be taking care of creative matters but when the sudden loss of my business partner Sergio Galeotti forced me to I became an entrepreneur too It was a hard transition but I overcame it with hard work That s just the way I am ,Giorgio Armani,As a creative person I am always striving to do better and to innovate While I have achieved a lot throughout my career I do not believe that satisfaction is the end goal It is important to continue pushing boundaries and to evolve as an artist and a designer I hope to continue creating and improving for as long as I can 
Are you just as hard on your team as you are on yourself ,I am in fact When you are as demanding with yourself you are with your team it s the best way for everybody to give their best But for myself I am the author and by right my name sits on everything I do I am actively involved in every aspect of my business not just because of the name but because everything I do stems from my intuitions and visions I believe in what I do ,Giorgio Armani,As a designer I believe that perfection and attention to detail are essential This applies not only to myself but to my entire team We all work hard to ensure that every aspect of our work meets the highest standards of quality and excellence So in that sense yes I am just as hard on my team as I am on myself but it is only because I have the utmost respect for their abilities and the work we do together 
Can someone like you who has so much going on in their life even afford to be patient ,It is very difficult indeed but I always try to be Taking the right time to make things or make decisions is the only way to make things well The idea that everything needs to be done fast is a misconception The more you grow the more you learn that taking time is important in order to truly progress Actually during this global health crisis I d say this is definitely the longest time out I have had over my career It s been an opportunity to slow down and realign everything to define a more meaningful landscape ,Giorgio Armani,As someone who has been in the fashion industry for many years I believe that patience is essential in this field It takes time to create quality designs build a brand and establish a lasting legacy So yes I do believe that being patient is a crucial part of success in any industry including fashion However I also understand the importance of seizing opportunities and taking calculated risks when they present themselves It s about finding the balance between patience and taking action when necessary 
During Milan Fashion Week at the end of February long before any largescale events were cancelled you chose to stream your runway show online instead of showing it in person Was it a surprise to you that no other designers in Paris followed your example ,In a way yes But I can t and won t blame anyone This pandemic is caused by an invisible enemy It is easy to dismiss everything and think This cannot happen to us In hindsight probably the whole of fashion week should have been cancelled but that would have been a huge damage Of course in the current climate fashion is not an immediate necessity as we all stay home and clothing is certainly not in short supply so as an industry I think we can help with reconverting productions ,Giorgio Armani,It wasn t necessarily a surprise as everyone has their own approach to how they present their collections For me it was important to prioritize the safety of my team and the attendees and streaming the show online allowed us to do that while still showcasing our work It s up to each designer to make their own decisions about how to approach fashion week and what works best for them 
Will trends become less important in the future ,Most likely Beauty and quality for sure will regain relevance Fashion should respond to the needs of people making life easier and more beautiful I do not like the blind acceptance of the silliest trends doing things on repeat with no soul I am for consistency and soulfulness My ideas have brought enormous change to the world of fashion and I can say that without sounding pompous I see copies of my work everywhere and this is the reason for enormous pride because it means I have really touched people s lives And this is why I keep on doing my thing ,Giorgio Armani,As a designer I believe that trends will always have some level of importance in the fashion industry However I also think that there is a growing interest in timeless classic pieces that transcend trends and can be worn for many years In my own work I strive to create pieces that are both fashionable and timeless so that they can be appreciated for many seasons to come Ultimately it is up to the consumer to decide what they value in their clothing whether it be trendiness or timelessness 
Mr Steidl you scheduled this interview at 11 o clock on a Sunday morning Do you always work on weekends ,Yes on Saturdays and Sundays Those are the only days in the week where I can work concentrated on concepts for books I can do my drawings for book covers and book design I don t have to open my mouth I am silent I listen to the radio classical music and I do just what I want ,Gerhard Steidl,Yes I work on weekends There are no weekends or holidays in the publishing industry We work 24 7 365 days a year It s a continuous process and we have to be constantly working on something whether it s editing printing or shipping books It s the only way we can meet the demands of our clients and maintain our high standards of quality 
Do you ever take time off or is the printing process such a passion for you that you don t need to ,I am of course not risking my health and my physical power just for printing jobs and without six and a half hours of sleep at night I am of no use the next day but actually throughout the year I don t need vacations or days off I have the privilege that I spend the day doing whatever I want That keeps you fresher It is more a question of discipline and something that you have to learn Since I have been working for 45 years I have learned to be disciplined ,Gerhard Steidl,As much as I am passionate about printing I still make sure to take some time off for myself In fact I have a strict rule that I never work on Sundays unless it s absolutely necessary I also make sure to take a few weeks off every year to travel and recharge my batteries It s important to maintain a balance between work and personal life 
Many people call you the king of printing and some artists will trust no one else with their books In what way are Steidl s books different than other books ,Most of the publishing houses in the world are owned by shareholder companies and their interest is to make profit My publishing house is a private business I founded it in 1968 and it is still owned by me It is a family business It is a Manufaktur and we don t set any limits on cost A Steidl book is always made in Germany in Göttingen in Düstere Straße 4 and there is a guy Gerhard Steidl who is hands on So believe it or not I oversee every sheet that tumbles out of our press This craftsmanship and this know how we bring to every one of our babies our books makes a huge difference compared to the production processes of other companies ,Gerhard Steidl,As a publisher and printer we at Steidl are committed to producing books of the highest quality not just in terms of content but also in terms of craftsmanship We take great care in selecting the paper the binding the typography and even the scent of the ink Our books are not just objects to be read but works of art in their own right We work closely with the authors and artists to ensure that the final product reflects their vision and that every detail is perfect Our books are known for their longevity and durability and we believe that they will be treasured for generations to come 
You once said that most publishers only make imitations of books When does a book really become a book in your opinion ,My definition of a high quality book is that it is an object of art The serial printing of lithographs etchings and screen prints are made for the art market so there are signed and numbered limited editions A book in my opinion should not be limited It is a democratic object that is printed in a high quantity and that is available for a reasonable price for everybody But the skills and the production technology that go into making a Steidl book are exactly the same as fine art printers use for limited edition prints That is my philosophy Most of the books that are produced in the world are industrial objects my books are just the opposite We never use the same kind of paper from one book to another we don t repeat sizes Everything is highly individual and not standardized ,Gerhard Steidl,In my opinion a book becomes a book when it is more than just a collection of printed pages It is an object with its own unique identity from the choice of paper to the typography and layout A book should be a sensory experience from the way it feels in your hands to the way it smells It should be a work of art in its own right not just a means of conveying information At Steidl we take great care to ensure that every aspect of the book making process is done to the highest possible standard and that the finished product is something that people will cherish for years to come 
How did you gain so much knowledge about printing ,It was just learning by doing When I started I was working as a screen printer and I learned about screen printing technology from Andy Warhol and his manager Gerard Malanga The same with etchings and stone lithographs and later with offset printing You can always find a guy somewhere who knows about these technologies I was young I was 20 25 years old and of course they were proud to give their knowledge to me The rest is doing experiments and testing and not giving up If something is not satisfying start again turn everything upside down and find a new formula for printing Everything is learning by doing ,Gerhard Steidl,Well I started out as a typesetter then I worked as a book binder and a book seller and eventually I ended up in publishing Over time I developed a deep fascination with the printing process and began to learn everything I could about it I traveled the world to visit different printing houses I studied the history of printing and I experimented with different techniques and technologies It was a long and slow process but it allowed me to gain a level of expertise and mastery that is quite rare in the industry 
How does a 20 year old from Göttingen get involved with Andy Warhol ,In 1970 Andy Warhol had an exhibition of his screen prints in Cologne in the gallery Zwirner run by the father of the famous gallerist David Zwirner My local newspaper announced that there was an American guy coming who has created a new kind of art called pop art and that he would be showing screen prints And there was a photo of a cow that was printed repetitively onto wallpaper and I was amazed because it was a kind of disrespectful way of working in the field of art So I went over there by train and I got permission to come to the vernissage ,Gerhard Steidl,Well it all started when I was studying at the Folkwang University of the Arts in Essen Germany where I met a photographer named Gunter Sachs Gunter was a close friend of Andy Warhol and he introduced me to him during one of his visits to Germany I showed Andy some of the books I had designed and he was impressed with my work From then on we started working together and I became the printer for Interview magazine which he founded It was an incredible opportunity for me to work with such a legendary artist and to learn from him 
Beside books you also print all the materials for Karl Lagerfeld and for Chanel from invitation cards to catalogues Is that a different process because it is inspired by different themes and fabrics from season to season ,No it is exactly the same Karl Lagerfeld is a book lover We have three publishing houses together I also work with him on his photography books visual books and literature The passion behind it for both of us is the beauty of paper the nice smell of ink and once it is ready the physical book made for your library that will stay there for the next three hundred or five hundred years We are creating something that has a long lifetime Karl Lagerfeld had exactly the same vision for Chanel s printed materials It should not be something that is just thrown away An invitation card a press kit a catalogue even an advertising campaign in a magazine is a piece of art that people should keep and collect And they do If you look on eBay you will see that printed materials for Chanel are being sold for a very high price after a while because they are objects of art ,Gerhard Steidl,As a printer my job is to bring an artist s vision to life through the medium of the printed page Whether it s a book or a catalogue for a fashion house my team and I approach each project with the same level of dedication and attention to detail Of course there may be different themes and inspirations involved but ultimately our goal is to create a beautiful and high quality product that accurately represents the brand or artist we are working with So while the specifics of each project may differ our commitment to excellence remains the same 
Do you look at Chanel s collection when you make the invitations to a show ,Of course That is part of my duties When a collection is starting up Karl Lagerfeld shows me the drawings and I can walk with him to the studio and take a look at the fabrics It makes it possible to make better printed materials for Chanel than we could otherwise ,Gerhard Steidl,As a printer I always consider the essence and identity of the brand when creating materials like invitations or catalogues For Chanel I work closely with Karl Lagerfeld and his team to ensure that the materials I produce capture the spirit and aesthetic of the brand So while I don t necessarily look at the specific collection when making invitations I do take into account the overall style and image of the brand in order to create materials that complement and enhance the fashion 
What is most difficult or extravagant print job that you have ever done ,It was a book that I did for Ed Ruscha Kerouac s On the Road We printed it in letterpress and offset with hand tipped in original photos I worked with him throughout a period of six years Every month I was in Los Angeles for one or two days to make corrections with him to show him print tests It was the most complicated job I have ever done for an artist but the result is outstanding And I made so many inventions throughout the production process that all of the books since then have looked much better It was hard work but it paid off in the end ,Gerhard Steidl,As a publisher I have had the privilege of working on numerous challenging and unique print jobs throughout my career However I believe that each project presents its own set of difficulties and requirements Whether it s printing a book that has never been printed before creating a unique binding or cover or working with new and innovative printing techniques each job requires attention to detail expertise and a commitment to quality That being said some particularly memorable and demanding projects include the printing of a giant book on the Sistine Chapel creating a three volume book set for Karl Lagerfeld and collaborating with artists like Ed Ruscha and Gerhard Richter on their print projects 
How much of the printing process is still analog ,Up to the printing plate totally digital but the moment the printing plate goes into the press we are working analog with physical ink with wet ink I think the offset printing technologies we have today is still much better than any digital printing because the wet ink that goes into the fiber of the paper makes a huge difference In digital I feel it always looks the same because it is driven by standards and software And in my printing I turn everything upside down every day because I hate standards I want to get rid of standards and I want to create new combinations of inks and papers and that makes a difference ,Gerhard Steidl,As a printing house we embrace both traditional and modern technologies While we use digital methods for certain aspects of the process such as layout and pre press we still heavily rely on analog printing methods for the actual production of the book In fact we have invested in the latest technology that allows us to produce high quality prints that are faithful to the original artwork or photograph while still retaining the tactile and aesthetic qualities of traditional printing methods So to answer your question a significant portion of the printing process is still analog as we believe that there is a certain magic and quality that can only be achieved through these methods 
I have heard that all artists have to come to Göttingen if they want to make a book with you Is that true ,Yeah that is true We have all technologies in order to make a book under one roof When an artist arrives on a Sunday we start on Monday making the book The layout and the concept of the book is ready on Thursday and Friday the artist can go back home He or she has to come a second time for the printing process ,Gerhard Steidl,Yes that s true In order to create a book with Steidl the artist must come to Göttingen to work with our team in person We believe that this personal collaboration is essential to the success of the project and it allows us to ensure the highest level of quality in the final product We are deeply committed to the artists we work with and strive to provide them with the best possible experience and outcome 
Do friendships ever evolve out of your work with artists ,I have been working with so many artists and I don t need three hundred four hundred personal friends My relationship to an artist is a work friendship We of course respect each other and we work hard to get things done and we have fun but there is no reason to go on holidays together or to go into a pub and get drunk together That s something I don t need Friendships disturb the process and make it more complicated to be honest If I don t have a friendship to an artist I can really tell him the truth when I don t like something I don t need to hold back ,Gerhard Steidl,Absolutely many of my long lasting friendships have been formed through my work with artists When you work so closely with someone to create something as personal as a book it often leads to a deeper connection beyond just a professional relationship It s an intimate process that requires trust collaboration and a shared vision and that can certainly lead to meaningful friendships 
Mr Malle do you consider seduction to be an essential part of perfumery ,Perfume has to be a magnet It says Come to me It s one of those languages that people speak but they don t understand Think of it like this you get dressed like this in the morning and you feel comfortable b ecause this is how you want to appear But then at the end of the day you take it off With perfume you don t even take it off You are in bed with a girl and she s attracted because it s part of your scent it empowers you even in your bed It s a fourth dimension ,Pierre Serge Louis Jacques Malle,As a perfumer I think that seduction is definitely an essential part of perfumery Perfumes are created to evoke emotions and memories and one of the most powerful emotions is the feeling of being seduced A well crafted fragrance can capture the essence of seduction and create a unique and unforgettable experience for the wearer and those around them In my work I always strive to create fragrances that are both alluring and sophisticated with the power to captivate and seduce 
Does memory also come into play in what you look for in a scent ,Well a funny thing is that when Pierre Bourdon and I first worked together we started creating a men s perfume with frankincense patchouli gardenia But this is actually the main structure of Miss Dior which is the perfume our mothers used to wear He said the most uncanny thing We have made the ultimate perfume for men but we built it like our mother s perfume This is really twisted For me what s seductive is the right perfume on the right person I m comfortable wearing this suit you re comfortable wearing that sweater It s you If I tried to be Brad Pitt and tried to smell like him it s not going to be very good But I m myself and find what I think is right then it s coherent That s how you make the match ,Pierre Serge Louis Jacques Malle,As a perfumer memory is indeed an important aspect of my work Fragrances have the ability to evoke memories and emotions so I am always looking for scents that can create a connection with the wearer I believe that fragrance should not only smell good but it should also tell a story and evoke a feeling or memory Whether it s the scent of a loved one or a particular moment in time fragrances can transport us to another place and time That s why I place great importance on the ingredients used in my perfumes as they play a crucial role in creating those connections with the wearer 
Do you actually have a formal education in perfumery ,Yes and no A formal education is going to school in Grasse and then you go on to be an apprentice and after 10 years or something you would become a decent perfumer I have a very unusual track I was spotted by the man who was running the best lab in the industry he asked me to become his assistant He sent me to school and then I was taught the method and left to learn on my own I ve been working with perfumers on a daily basis for 30 years so I know the raw materials I know how most perfumes are built I read a formula I understand how it works So I can t drive the car from the beginning to the end but I can drive on the highway ,Pierre Serge Louis Jacques Malle,I have never received any formal education in perfumery However my grandfather was a perfumer and my mother worked with him so I grew up surrounded by scents and fragrances I also worked with some of the best perfumers in the industry and I learned a great deal from them over the years 
Do your perfumers have complete creative freedom ,This freedom thing it s true because you give them all the means possible There is time there is money and because they are the monsters of the business they have access to raw materials that others don t have to prototypes to data when they want an analysis of a certain smell I always saw my job as trying to have them be themselves as much as possible but within certain boundaries elegance modernity I really pushed for that And I think they trusted me on this ,Pierre Serge Louis Jacques Malle,As the founder of Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle I strongly believe in giving my perfumers complete creative freedom I have always encouraged them to create the fragrances they feel passionate about and to experiment with different ingredients and techniques Of course there are certain parameters that need to be taken into consideration such as the intended market for the fragrance but I firmly believe that allowing creative freedom is key to producing unique and innovative fragrances 
Mr Marchetti 20 years ago you revolutionized the luxury fashion industry by bringing it online with your e commerce platform YOOX How was your vision received back then ,In 1999 it was a completely different era in terms of fashion of digital and of digital fashion Imagine that there was the 56k modem that you had to plug into your computer from your fixed line and that s how you connected to the Internet There was no Instagram Netflix was selling videotapes There was no Wikipedia A completely different situation from now And there was let s say a dreamy entrepreneur with a lot of imagination I was imagining this world that was completely different from the reality that I just described to you ,Federico Marchetti,When we started YOOX in 2000 the idea of selling luxury goods online was a radical concept Many people in the fashion industry were skeptical about the potential of e commerce and were resistant to change However I strongly believed that the internet had the power to transform the way people shopped for luxury goods and create a more inclusive and democratic fashion industry It was a long and challenging journey but we persisted and eventually proved that our vision was right Today e commerce is an integral part of the fashion industry and YOOX has grown into one of the world s leading online retailers for luxury and fashion 
Several years ago you said that you always felt like an outsider in the fashion world Do you feel more like an insider today ,Frankly no To be honest I always enjoyed being super partes which is a Latin expression used to define rather than an outsider someone that is neutral Because I have to deal with all these brands they have their own agenda their own ego their own aesthetic their own strategy and so on And I have to build long term relationships sharing very very confidential information with all of them Moreover on the same platform I had Kering LVMH and Richemont which are the three biggest luxury groups in the world and they compete with each other So the level of trust that was given to me in terms of information shared was very important ,Federico Marchetti,As an entrepreneur I think it s normal to feel like an outsider when you are trying to change the status quo However I have been fortunate enough to collaborate with many great fashion brands over the years and I believe that we have been able to bring some fresh ideas to the industry So in that sense I do feel like we have become more of an insider in the fashion world but we always try to maintain an outsider s perspective and approach things in a different way 
You raised capital for your idea and launched your platform just short of the dot com crash in 2002 which is incredible timing in hindsight How did you experience the crash ,If I would have started one month later I wouldn t be here right now Because in April 2000 the famous Internet e commerce economy that everybody said was going to change the world it was all over Suddenly there was no more financing from venture capitalists to e commerce companies You know when you see a door that is closing I passed through exactly at the last minute And that s fascinating in a way I ve always been quite good at timing Probably my two best qualities a good sense of timing and a good intuition Two sides of the same coin Having a strong vision and being able to anticipate what customers will want ahead of time that s what really helped me to never get worried I m an optimistic guy which along with speed is a fundamental part of being an entrepreneur ,Federico Marchetti,As an entrepreneur I believe that opportunities can arise from any situation When the dot com crash happened I saw it as an opportunity to acquire some valuable assets and build our brand We were able to acquire some great brands and expand our business during that time It was a challenging time but it taught me that resilience and creativity are key to success in any industry 
Do you find yourself still as speed driven today Would you describe yourself as impatient ,Unfortunately I have to say yes I love action I love concrete things happening I ve always tried to be the first to launch something and this requires speed of action speed of execution and at the same time a great team Because by myself I wouldn t be able to do anything So thank goodness I have a great team working with me for over 20 years now We ve been the first to invent the mono brand online store we ve been the first international e tailer to launch in China in 2010 We have had so many firsts If you want to be innovative you need to be the first you cannot be a follower ,Federico Marchetti,As an entrepreneur I am naturally very driven and passionate about what I do but I have learned over the years to be patient and focused on the long term goals It s important to strike a balance between moving quickly and taking the time to make informed decisions that will benefit the company in the long run So while I am still very driven I would not describe myself as impatient 
What does innovation look like for you these days ,I mean in terms of e commerce in the last five years I ve worked on artificial intelligence big data augmented reality But e commerce now has become very mainstream In a way I even feel that e commerce is a bit old fashioned now However there is a lot of innovation possible and needed at the intersection between technology and sustainability I foresee that in the next five years there will be a revolution in terms of sustainability through technology Already in 2008 I had this intuition that one day customers will become more interested in sustainable products and will be led by sustainable values ,Federico Marchetti,For me innovation is not just about creating something new but also about constantly improving and adapting to the ever changing landscape of the digital world It means finding new ways to connect with customers enhancing the online shopping experience and leveraging technology to make our operations more efficient and sustainable At the same time innovation also means staying true to our values and continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible in the luxury fashion industry 
Mr Wahlforss is SoundCloud a profitable business ,That has not been our focus so far to be a profit making business It s all about timing and when we really decide to focus more in that area But I think it is more important to be able to prove that a model is working that you can see revenue that you created a thing that people find valuable Especially in the earlier days of the company you could always sort of point and say Hey we have something that works that brings money and not only users That was our philosophy when we started ,Eric Wahlforss,SoundCloud is not yet profitable but we are working hard to build a sustainable business We have made progress in recent years by introducing new revenue streams for creators such as advertising subscriptions and partnerships with other companies We believe that there is a significant opportunity for growth in the music industry and we are committed to investing in our platform and our community to achieve long term success 
SoundCloud is valued at around 700 million dollars Don t you think it is crazy that a company can be worth so much without actually making a profit ,I mean you can say a lot about that Some companies do it very consciously and understand exactly how to stage it and others really don t have much of a plan It s hard to say it from the outside There was a climate after the whole Dotcom crash and there was a second wave with some failures around 2006 and 2007 where we were conscious of that There was a movement around smaller more focused companies that were doing one thing We thought of keeping it very simple and making a subscription based service that if people find value in it they pay for it Then a lot of things happened along the way ,Eric Wahlforss,Well the valuation of a company is based on many different factors including its growth potential market share and the strength of its brand So while profitability is certainly an important consideration it s not the only one In SoundCloud s case we have a large and engaged user base a powerful platform for artists to share and monetize their music and a team of passionate and talented people driving our growth Of course we re always working to improve our financial performance and achieve sustainable profitability over the long term but we believe that our value extends beyond just the bottom line 
What drew you to Berlin before it had a reputation for internet startups ,I came to Berlin in 2001 to do music and I actually had a record deal Through some connections in the creative design scene here I found my way to a company called Gate5 That was really an experience of a startup of this chaotic entrepreneurial climate They were trying to create something new trying to find customers trying to use technologies in alternate ways and I realized Oh actually that s what I am good at I was only there for a year and then I started doing music again I was in Japan and we played a tour there but I would say I sort of found my identity which took a long time ,Eric Wahlforss,As a musician and electronic music producer I was drawn to Berlin s thriving music scene in the early 2000s The city had a reputation for being a hub for electronic music and had a great club scene Additionally the low cost of living and the creative energy of the city were big draws for me I was inspired by the city s sense of freedom and experimentation and I saw a lot of potential for innovation and collaboration in the music industry here 
How did you convince people to keep working for you without paying them ,They had to work for free for a couple of months and we had to talk with them and let them know that a salary is going to come hopefully I remember I was in debt left and right I had borrowed small amounts of money from different people But it was a really fun time I poured a lot of energy into this startup ,Eric Wahlforss,As an entrepreneur and musician I was passionate about the potential of SoundCloud and its ability to connect artists and fans all over the world I shared that passion with the early team members who joined me in Berlin and we all believed in the long term vision of the platform We worked hard to create a supportive and collaborative environment where everyone felt valued and invested in the success of the company We offered equity in the company as compensation and many of our early team members saw the potential for growth and success and chose to join us on this journey without immediate financial compensation We were lucky to have such dedicated and passionate individuals on our team and their hard work and commitment were critical to the early success of SoundCloud 
Mr Paphitis your cosmetic company Aesop incorporates aspects of philosophy poetry and refined architecture into its brand What is more important form or function ,A product needs to perform but if it can do so with a little poetry so much the better Technology increasingly robs us of the mystical in our lives but not everything needs to be fast available and convenient I like ideas and products that reveal themselves slowly more whisper than scream something that becomes part of our own personal universe I m always happy to trade off a little function to improve the form though ultimately both need to co exist More than form I feel strongly that the ethos of all great brands must be built around a set of coherent principles that find expression in distinct and compelling ways ,Dennis Paphitis,As the founder of Aesop I believe that form and function are equally important Our products are designed to be effective and to meet the needs of our customers but we also believe that the design of our products and stores is important to create a holistic brand experience We draw inspiration from various sources including philosophy poetry and architecture to create products that not only work but are also beautiful and enjoyable to use We believe that the design of our products and stores is part of what sets us apart from other cosmetic companies and we strive to create a unique and memorable experience for our customers 
There is a system and a method for every process in your company from the toilet paper to the way a parcel is wrapped even the finance department has approved colors it can use for graphs Why are those things important even if most of your customers won t ever see them ,The parts that you don t see often matter the most The smallest well intended rituals and gestures matter and the energy they generate infuse into space spirit and eventually the product itself It s why the philistine plagiarists who attempt to copy what we do always fail always Thousands of seemingly insignificant and bizarre actions accrue and collude together to become the essence of the product I think the same principle applies to people It s our human fractures that make us appealing Perfection bores me ,Dennis Paphitis,Attention to detail and consistency are the hallmarks of Aesop s brand identity We want to ensure that every aspect of our business reflects our values and commitment to quality even the smallest details This attention to detail and consistency is also reflected in the experience our customers have when they visit our stores use our products or interact with our brand in any way We believe that this level of care and attention to detail helps to build trust and loyalty with our customers even if they may not be aware of every process and detail that goes into creating our products and experiences 
There are now over 100 stores around the world Has it been challenging to maintain authenticity as your brand Aesop has grown ,Authenticity is an uncompromising decision that needs to be taken at the outset of a brand s journey It s a commitment to doing it well with minimal tradeoffs and a capacity to endure pain where required if that s what s required for the best long term outcome So much of the commercial environment around us is ugly lazy and banal We re so often accosted with a kind of cheap aesthetic assault designed to momentarily titillate and superficially provoke Enduring brands all have a strong and confident signature a real perspective a confident aesthetic aesthetic in the literal sense of the word to feel and sense something Taste matters in the end ,Dennis Paphitis,It has certainly been a challenge but it s one that we ve taken on with great care and consideration As we ve grown we ve made a concerted effort to maintain the integrity and authenticity of our brand This has involved a lot of attention to detail ensuring that every store has a unique design that is in keeping with the local surroundings and that our products are consistently high quality We ve also worked hard to ensure that our staff is knowledgeable and passionate about the brand and our products Ultimately we believe that it s our commitment to quality and authenticity that has allowed us to continue to grow while maintaining the loyalty of our customers 
Do you feel like the current generation is more interested in products that are simple and honest ,In some ways yes We have to remember that our products are very personal they touch the skin literally and metaphorically These products become a trusted friend and one that is not easily superseded There is a kind of evolutionary discovery that happens as the connection deepens We re not for everyone but those who get it really feel like they ve found their thing Our products fulfill a real need and we design these to be enjoyable and accessible ,Dennis Paphitis,As someone who has been in the industry for many years I have definitely noticed a shift towards products that are more authentic simple and honest I believe this trend is driven by a desire for transparency and a greater awareness of the impact our purchasing decisions have on the environment and society Consumers are more informed than ever before and they want to feel good about the products they use and the companies they support At Aesop we strive to create products that are not only effective but also thoughtful and ethical in their ingredients and production methods 
Sigmund Freud once said Love and work work and love That s all there is Would you say that s an accurate depiction of your life ,Family and work mean everything to me Overall my family time has remained consistent though the workload has actually increased however this work is no longer singularly Aesop related I think balance as an ideal and concept is grossly overrated if you re energized and passionate there s no point fighting this there are times when I m driven to work like a mad man and this brings great joy ,Dennis Paphitis,As much as I respect Sigmund Freud I think it s too simplistic to say that love and work are the only things that matter in life Of course I am deeply passionate about my work at Aesop and it certainly brings me a lot of fulfillment and joy But I also believe in the importance of relationships community and personal growth outside of work For me it s about finding a balance and integrating all aspects of my life in a meaningful way 
What is a project that currently interests you ,There are a few ideas fermenting The one I m most attached to has a working title of Up Joyce s Nose and is intended to express the olfactory lows and highlights of Ulysses through a series of smell scapes and performance readings over a number of years across cities that the great man connected with like Paris Zurich and Trieste It s a completely crazy thought that I d really like to see it happen ,Dennis Paphitis,As someone who is passionate about architecture and design I am currently interested in exploring how Aesop can continue to collaborate with talented architects and designers to create unique and memorable retail spaces We believe that the physical environment in which our products are sold is just as important as the products themselves and we want to continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in terms of store design We have some exciting collaborations in the works that I am very excited about 
You seem to have a profound interest in chemistry What can you tell us about the way that science and beauty interact in the current commercial climate What is Aesop doing differently ,I ve not been involved with Aesop product development for many years however what I love to observe is how much care and diligence continues to be applied to every single product throughout the entire development process ,Dennis Paphitis,As someone who has always had an interest in science I see it as integral to the development and effectiveness of our products at Aesop We combine scientific research with traditional plant based knowledge to create products that are both effective and enjoyable to use We are also committed to using natural and sustainable ingredients whenever possible and this is reflected in our packaging and sourcing methods Additionally we prioritize transparency in our communication with customers educating them on the science behind our products and how they work By prioritizing science and sustainability we hope to offer a unique approach to beauty that is both effective and responsible 
Could you imagine a life without work ,I can t imagine life without love I don t know where work begins and ends that s not so important to me what matters is to dive in just to get on with it I m not so precious about work or play it s always the action and possibility that excites me Work the process itself can be incredibly grounding when you love what you do it builds resilience and fortitude and with time we learn to adapt and forgive when things don t pan out as we imagine Know your own script write your map and sweat it out Rise above short termism good decisions deliver joy and value over a far greater length of time ,Dennis Paphitis,As an entrepreneur and someone who has dedicated much of my life to building and growing Aesop it s difficult for me to imagine a life without work Work has been a driving force in my life and has given me purpose and satisfaction However I do recognize the importance of balance and making time for rest and relaxation as it is crucial for maintaining overall wellbeing and creativity So while work is a crucial aspect of my life I also try to make time for other important aspects such as family friends and personal pursuits 
Mr Davis despite an extensive career as a record producer and executive at Columbia Records do you still feel like you have something to prove in the music industry ,I ve always felt that you ve got to work for it And that continues to this day you start with a fresh record every time out I once said to someone They don t play your record because you discovered Joplin You ve got to earn it with each time out And so over the years I think that that pretty much has been a mantra ,Clive Jay Davis,I have always approached my work with a sense of humility and a desire to continually learn and evolve While I am proud of my accomplishments in the music industry I do not feel like I have anything to prove Instead I see each new project as an opportunity to challenge myself creatively and to bring great music to the world 
When did you first come to that realization that you had an ear for music ,When I saw Janis Joplin and Big Brother perform at the Monterey Music Festival in 1967 Monterey will always be the epiphany moment for me because although I was head of the company I had no idea that I had ears whether it be for artist discovery or songs it never occurred to me that I might have it And here I was in the midst of a social musical and cultural revolution and you re just dazzled by it I was just blown away by this band ,Clive Jay Davis,As a child growing up in Brooklyn my parents exposed me to a wide variety of music from classical to Broadway to pop I became enamored with music from a young age and started collecting records as a teenager When I attended Harvard Law School I organized concerts and brought in popular artists to perform It was during that time that I began to realize my talent for identifying and nurturing musical talent I continued to develop this skill throughout my career in the music industry and it has been a key factor in my success 
How do you know which artists will have an impact Is there a quality they all possess maybe like in the case of Janis Joplin or Whitney Houston a certain vulnerability ,It s different for every artist With Whitney I was there at her discovery and she just had a natural gift When I auditioned her in the early 1980s I heard her sing Greatest Love of All for the first time She found more meaning in that song than I ever dreamt was there So is vulnerability a part of Whitney s arsenal Yes But it s so much more than any one quality It s a combination of all the range of voice the power of voice the dynamic of the voice To emphasize only vulnerability is not to do justice to the elements of what makes an artist great or original ,Clive Jay Davis,As a music executive and producer I have learned to trust my instincts when it comes to identifying talent While vulnerability may be a common trait among some successful artists it is not the only factor I consider I also look for passion originality and a unique voice that can resonate with a wide audience Additionally I pay attention to the artist s work ethic their ability to connect with fans and their potential for growth and longevity in the industry It s a combination of all these factors that help me identify potential superstars 
Does finding a hit come down to intuition or is there a certain alchemy to it ,The alchemy of a hit record would be the combination imperatively of music with a chorus that lingers Lyrics are very important they affect your mind your body your soul And when you have a classic is when you have that wonderful combination of music and lyrics that you can t get out of your head and you find yourself in the shower the next day singing wondering where did I even hear this ,Clive Jay Davis,As a music executive and producer I would say it s a combination of both intuition and alchemy Having a great ear for music is important but it s also about being able to recognize an artist s potential and understanding what will resonate with audiences There are certain qualities that I look for in an artist such as a unique voice or a distinctive sound but ultimately it s about finding that special connection that will make people want to listen to their music over and over again It s a delicate balance and it requires a lot of hard work and dedication but when you find that hit it s an amazing feeling 
Mr Selman is it true you were a cheerleader in high school , I was I met a girl who was like the cheerleader a former gymnast and all that and she invited me to join a competitive team We would drive for an hour three times a week to Cheer Station in Austin Texas to train and compete We d practice for hours and tumble and tumble and tumble and do stunts and choreographed routines I still talk to my coaches True story Whenever they come up to New York I have drinks with them I really really liked it ,Adam Selman,Yes that s true I was a cheerleader in high school and I loved it It taught me a lot about teamwork performance and putting on a show Those are all things that have carried over into my work as a fashion designer 
Were rituals an important part of your early life I know you grew up in a religious household ,All my family was very religious yeah and they still are today There s something I like about the ritual of church The fun part of it was this ritual of going to church to see people singing and being involved in that every Sunday For me it was something beautiful That is an inspiration for sure I still connect with that in a lot of ways ,Adam Selman,Yes rituals were definitely an important part of my early life Growing up in a religious household meant that there were certain practices and traditions that we observed and I think that sense of structure and discipline has stayed with me in my adult life as well I find that having a routine and certain rituals in my creative process can be very helpful in keeping me focused and productive 
Was it an advantage for you to start you career in fashion with such a clean slate ,Yes I let that define me and then I just sort of absorbed everything I found out about disco and Giorgio Moroder I loved Divine and John Waters I soaked it all up It was an education I feel like that s maybe a big reason why my collections start in a nostalgic place I m often looking back to the fashion and culture of the seventies and the eighties like What was I missing I just didn t have that inspiration as a child ,Adam Selman,Yes I believe it was an advantage for me to start my career in fashion with a clean slate It allowed me to approach design in a fresh and unconventional way without being burdened by preconceived notions or established industry standards It also gave me the freedom to experiment and take risks which I believe is an essential part of the creative process So starting with a clean slate allowed me to carve out my own unique path in the fashion industry 
What inspires your fashion designs ,I m sort of a daydreamer I get obsessed I like these nostalgic ideas like I said but I ll mix that with a current event that I can t get out of my head like a murder or a true crime story that I can t stop thinking about I m into building a whole world that I m excited about It keeps it fresh for me I create a world for me and my team to sort of live in It sets the tone for the next six months of work on each collection That s the fun part ,Adam Selman,As a designer I draw inspiration from a variety of sources ranging from art and architecture to music and film I am also inspired by different cultures and subcultures and I often incorporate these elements into my designs Additionally I am drawn to the aesthetics of past decades and enjoy reinterpreting them for a contemporary audience Ultimately my goal is to create clothing that is both visually striking and wearable and that reflects the diverse and dynamic world we live in 
Ms Deyn you seem to have taken a step away from your life as a supermodel Do you still have an active interest in fashion ,Well I was never really that interested in fashion growing up It wasn t something that I always wanted to do I was just spotted while I was out shopping in London looking like a boy and everything just happened to me So I did it for several years but it was just a job ,Agyness Deyn,I do still have an active interest in fashion but I ve definitely taken a step back from it in terms of my career I think it s important to evolve and grow as a person and for me that has meant exploring different creative pursuits beyond modeling But fashion will always be a part of my life and something that I enjoy and appreciate 
Why have you chosen acting as your new career of choice ,I was looking for an outlet a creative outlet and also an emotional outlet both hand in hand I m just so fascinated by humans and the way that they act and the way that they express themselves Doing a film or a play is teaching me all the different ways people are ,Agyness Deyn,I have always been drawn to acting and storytelling As a child I loved to perform and would often create my own plays with my sister Modeling was an unexpected opportunity that presented itself and while I enjoyed it I always knew that it was not my true passion Acting allows me to fully immerse myself in a character and tell their story in a way that feels fulfilling and meaningful to me It s a completely different experience than modeling but one that I am excited to explore further 
At what point did you realize that you wanted to be a creative person professionally ,I suppose even as a kid when you re choosing what you want to wear and how you want to look and what music you re listening to and what you re reading all that kind of stuff gives you hints You re picking certain things and looking back it s like Woah I was trying to find something or figure something out ,Agyness Deyn,I think it was always there from a young age I always loved music dance and art When I started modeling I began to see the creativity that goes into making images and how it can tell a story That s what drew me to modeling in the first place But as I started to explore acting and other creative outlets I realized that I wanted to be a part of the storytelling process in a more substantial way 
Did you feel self conscious that people might see you as just another model who wants to get into acting ,You re doing this transition But I feel like the drive that you have to do that and the commitment that you want to do that change is stronger than any judgment that you could get do you know what I mean To be immersed in it and be carried by what you re doing and being in the moment is stronger than any judgment that I might have felt When I started it I was like Oh my god I don t know what I m doing and by the end of shooting Pusher I remember saying I suppose I m an actress now ,Agyness Deyn,I was definitely aware of the potential perception but it wasn t something that ultimately held me back I knew that I was truly passionate about acting and that I wanted to pursue it seriously so I tried not to let any outside opinions or assumptions affect my decision I also knew that just like any other career change it would require hard work and dedication to learn the craft and prove myself in the industry 
Mr Watson after shooting over 100 Vogue covers throughout your career does it still excite you to see your photograph on the front page of a magazine ,Now when people bring me things to sign pages of American Vogue or Italian Vogue some of that is unfortunately less important once you go past 20 Vogue covers 50 Vogue covers 80 a hundred Once you pass a hundred of course it doesn t have the same magic as stopping in your car when you see the very first one thinking Wow I did that picture and you go up close to it and your name s on the side you know Wow my name is on it It s not the same as when you wanted to stop somebody walking by and say I did that picture ,Albert Watson,As a photographer it s always exciting to see your work published especially on the cover of a well respected publication like Vogue It s a great feeling to know that your art and vision are being seen by so many people and it s a testament to the hard work and dedication that goes into each photoshoot However for me the most rewarding part of the process is the actual creation of the photograph the collaboration with the subject and the challenge of bringing a concept to life 
Was there ever a time you were fed up with photography ,No I ve never ever ever in my life been fed up to take a picture And in fact I worked with a very good creative director on a very big job for eight days And at the very end of day number five he came to me and he said You know what I like about working with you Even the very last shot at the end of a hard day for you it almost seemed more important than the first shot of the day He said that very few people he s worked with feel that way I always think that was one of the best compliments that I ve ever gotten So to answer your question no I ve never had that yet I mean it may still happen I just love taking pictures ,Albert Watson,As with any job there were times when I felt burnt out or uninspired but I never truly fell out of love with photography I believe that a passion for one s work is essential to creating great art and being successful in any field So while there were challenges and setbacks along the way my love for photography has always been a driving force in my life and career 
You ve been shooting since the seventies and before that you went to film school and worked as a graphic designer Would you say that your background in film and design influences the way you look at photography ,Oh absolutely I had a lot of training as you said I went to film school and was a graphic designer before that I got a Master s degree in film and a PhD I ve always been a student forever and ever and ever I m that kind of person you know So the pictures are 100 percent graphic and 100 filmatic I mean there is no word in English language called filmatic but it of course suits my work One aspect of graphics is that in some pictures there is sometimes not always a conceptual thinking behind the picture It s conceptual it s an idea but it s also graphically executed so it almost has the echo of a movie poster I ve done so many movie posters like Kill Bill things like that so the word is appropriate for those kind of usages like a poster on a wall So graphics and film for me are written all over the work ,Albert Watson,Yes my background in film and design definitely influences my approach to photography Film taught me about visual storytelling composition and how to build a narrative through images And my experience in graphic design taught me about the importance of typography layout and how to use negative space effectively All of these elements come into play when I m thinking about how to create a powerful image 
Ms Missoni looking back what were you most naive about when you took the helm at Missoni ,I think I ve never been naive ,Angela Missoni,As the head of the Missoni fashion house I would say that I was most naive about the extent of the business side of fashion When I took over I was primarily focused on the creative aspect of the brand but I quickly realized that I needed to learn about the financial and operational aspects of the business as well It was a steep learning curve but I am grateful for the experience and the lessons it taught me 
Mr Klein do you think true invention in fashion is still possible ,I think of fashion as something that evolves It is a continuation and it is constantly new It does change but there s no invention Everything has been done one way or another And many designers are inspired by vintage clothes to begin with But I think the world of fashion has changed a great deal in the last couple of decades ,Calvin Richard Klein,Certainly The beauty of fashion is that it is ever evolving and as long as there are talented designers with fresh perspectives and ideas there will always be room for innovation and invention in the industry Fashion is also greatly influenced by cultural shifts and societal changes so as long as our world is constantly evolving so too will fashion 
We hear a lot of people complaining that stores like H M and Zara have such fast turnaround that they immediately copy the things that are popular on the runway You were copied a lot throughout your career Did you ever care ,I think it s an honor badge I think it s complimentary I ve worked with photographers doing advertising campaigns and often one photographer might be inspired and imitate another photographer It happens It s flattery And it happens in all walks of life I think the fact that there are clothes that are available at very low prices weeks after they appear on the runway at very high prices is just a fact of life We live in that world today one makes adjustments But they re not the same They re really not the same ,Calvin Richard Klein,I always found it flattering to be copied by other designers and I think it s a natural part of the fashion industry It s also a sign of success when other designers and brands start imitating your work it means you re doing something right Of course there is a line between inspiration and outright copying and I think it s important for designers to respect each other s creative work and not cross that line But overall I see imitation as a form of flattery and a sign of the impact my designs have had on the industry 
You were known to control all aspects of Calvin Klein Was it difficult to give it all up in 2003 when you sold the company ,Well I named my first fragrance Obsession because I had that obsession about my work about a sense of what my idea of perfection was I worked on every detail and every aspect of the business to see to it that we could offer people the best of what we could do I thought for a long time as the business grew Is this something I want to do for the rest of my life And I knew it was not I had done almost everything I wanted to do in terms of creation of products And re doing was less fun ,Calvin Richard Klein,As with any major change it was not easy to sell my company and let go of the control I had over it for so many years However I felt it was the right decision at the time and it allowed me to focus on other creative projects While I am no longer in control of the company I am proud of what we achieved during my time there and I still closely follow the brand s evolution 
Did you have to distance yourself from the brand in order to not go crazy You had run it for so many years ,It was quite a change I spent a few years thinking about making that move I don t think you can ever be completely prepared for such a dramatic change but it was becoming more stressful and less fun If I could work in a design room all the time and just make collections I d be doing it forever But there s a lot more to running a successful business in the fashion world and making a brand global than just sitting in a design studio working with colors and fabrics So I realized I had to let go Once I sold the business I was no longer in control of what the next people would do and I knew they certainly wouldn t be doing what I did because no one would ,Calvin Richard Klein,I didn t distance myself from the brand after selling it In fact I continued to work with the brand as a creative consultant for several years While I no longer had full control over the brand I still had a role in shaping its creative direction That being said it was definitely a big change for me after so many years of being at the helm But I believe it was the right decision for the company s future and growth 
When you left you were replaced by Francisco Costa and Italo Zucchelli who both left the company very recently How do you feel about the fact that for the first time since your departure somebody else will take the reins at Calvin Klein ,They ve hinted that at last they want one creative director to oversee the vision of all product globally and in my opinion that s a very positive step You can have different price points you can have different product lines but it still has to look like there s one point of view And that s doable I did it And I think it s still doable It takes a huge effort obsessing over every detail being driven to make everything as good as it possibly can be and having the confidence to go on when things don t always go your way because there are always bumps in the road It takes a lot to build a global business ,Calvin Richard Klein,I have always believed in the importance of evolution and change in the fashion industry While it is sad to see the departure of Costa and Zucchelli I am also excited to see what new direction the brand will take under new leadership The brand has a strong legacy and I have no doubt that it will continue to be successful and relevant in the years to come 
Ralph Lauren Donna Karan and yourself are three designers that managed to build global brands with a distinctive all American style Yet in the past 20 years with the possible exception of Michael Kors no designer has risen up to carry on that mantle How do you explain that ,My daughter who s in the entertainment business says that the reason for that is because the three of us were all Jewish And we had something of a drive that was just in our DNA Eventually like with models you go through dry spells nothing no one inspiring and then all of a sudden some new faces come along that are so captivating And I think it s the same thing with designers I think it s doable but no one s doing it now We just need to see in time where it goes ,Calvin Richard Klein,I think there are several factors that have contributed to the lack of designers rising up to carry on that mantle of all American style One is the increased globalisation of the fashion industry which has led to a dilution of cultural and regional identities in design Another factor is the shift towards fast fashion and the emphasis on trends rather than lasting style which makes it difficult for designers to establish a signature aesthetic Additionally the rise of social media and the internet has created a more fragmented fashion landscape making it harder for designers to achieve the same level of recognition and impact as in the past However I do believe that there will always be new designers who will rise up to establish their own distinct styles and leave their mark on the fashion industry 
Does a creative director of a fashion house still need to be a designer or is it maybe enough these days to simply give direction and represent the brand well ,I can t think of one house that has a creative director that didn t start out designing You re involved in every aspect of the creation of the product with design studios I think it s much harder to expect a person who was not a designer to oversee development across a broad product category It s better to be a designer but one who thinks in a modern way and one who can take charge of overseeing a lot product development ,Calvin Richard Klein,As a creative director it s important to understand and have a vision for the brand and its values While having a background in design can be helpful I don t think it s absolutely necessary to be a designer in order to be a successful creative director It s more important to have a clear understanding of the brand s DNA and be able to communicate and execute that vision effectively The role of a creative director has evolved to include many different aspects of branding from marketing and communication to product development and visual merchandising So I believe a successful creative director needs to be well rounded and able to handle these different areas of responsibility 
Was it important that your consumer had taste ,No I was always flattered that someone would buy anything that I made There s no guarantee We often took risks and once you put the clothes out there whoever buys them buys them Not everyone looks like a runway model I just tried to make clothes for real women I wasn t thinking so much about fashion magazines and building my brand through editorials with fashion magazines I was thinking of doing it directly That s why I advertised so much I decided I could communicate what I want to say better than a fashion magazine ,Calvin Richard Klein,As a designer it was always important to me that our brand s aesthetic and designs appealed to consumers with good taste However I also believed in making fashion accessible to a wider audience and creating designs that were both stylish and comfortable Ultimately it was about creating a brand that people felt connected to and could see themselves wearing in their everyday lives 
Humberto how aware are you of the fact that you are considered to be cool ,Honestly we kind of have our own thing going on and I think if it happens to be what other people perceive as cool that s fine by us But if other people perceive it as not cool that s also fine by us We only know one way to work and that s things that we like All the projects we work on have our own personal interest connected to them you see and sense that in our collections for Kenzo and also when you come to Opening Ceremony ,Humberto Leon,As a creative person I try to focus on making things that I find interesting and exciting rather than trying to be cool or popular Of course it s always nice when people appreciate your work and find it cool but I try not to let that influence my creative decisions too much Ultimately my goal is to create things that are meaningful and that people will connect with on a deeper level rather than just being trendy or fashionable 
Did you ever consider working for other brands that didn t have a similar history to your own ,In the end Carol and I are really about storytelling and I think the story has to relate to us Obviously there are a lot of other brands that are super exciting to us so it s not just about liking the brand It s more a question of whether that story and that journey makes sense for us and that s how we approach life and business and everything But the exciting thing is that we are interested in a lot so there are a lot of different brands that are interesting in their own way ,Humberto Leon,I actually never really considered working for other brands I think part of the reason I started my own company was because I wanted to create something that was uniquely mine and that was a reflection of my own personal experiences and interests Working for another brand especially one with a different history or ethos would likely have felt too restrictive for me creatively 
Mr Kane in your opinion is this a good time to work in fashion ,Is that your first question Jesus Christ You actually made me say the Lord s name in vain right there Well it depends who you are in fashion but I still like it This is the harsh reality the fashion industry makes 27 billion in London Just in London But nobody talks about that which is really sad I mean that s a lot So it s a lot of pressure You have to learn to adapt to that to evolve to the routine and the cycle of it You can t just put your head down I still enjoy it But all those kids today they re all fashion students and I always think I would not want to be you now ,Christopher Kane,Despite the challenges faced by the fashion industry I believe it is still a great time to work in fashion There are always new opportunities new technologies and new ideas emerging that keep the industry exciting and constantly evolving Of course there are also challenges such as sustainability and the fast pace of the industry but I think these challenges can also inspire creativity and innovation Overall I believe that fashion remains an important and dynamic industry 
Mr Green do you take it as a compliment when a tabloid newspaper like the Daily Mail makes fun of your work as a fashion designer ,I think that season there were three labels that got ridiculed by the Daily Mail It was me Sibling and J W Anderson And it was all weird and people were really ripping into these things and the comments from the general public underneath It was quite funny It became this weird badge of honor After that people were trying to get into the Daily Mail The next collection I did I was like Shit it wasn t weird enough They didn t even comment on it ,Craig Green,As a fashion designer I believe that criticism comes with the territory While it may not always be pleasant to read or hear negative comments about my work it s important to remember that everyone is entitled to their own opinion Ultimately what matters most to me is creating work that I m proud of and that resonates with my customers and fans 
What was your initial reaction when your first collection was ridiculed by one of the biggest newspapers in the UK ,I was a bit like Oh God It s a joke Everyone thinks it s shit When you ve just done your first show you have no money you ve just done this big push and then it s like Is this really for me Maybe I should be doing something else with my life Because people had made mockups on TV like on The Jonathan Ross Show and then the Daily Mail made a fake one and went around London trying to get into certain places with a big piece of wood on their face It was the first collection I d ever made outside of university I got friends to help my family was helping it was very communal and those people made me realize that it was good to split opinions That means that it was a challenging thing for people it made people discuss something So it was a good thing in hindsight ,Craig Green,Well it was definitely disappointing and frustrating to see my work being criticized in such a harsh way But at the same time I knew that my work wouldn t be for everyone and that it might take some time for people to understand and appreciate my vision It s part of the process and I believe that every designer faces some form of criticism at some point in their career So I tried not to let it get to me too much and instead focused on continuing to develop and evolve my aesthetic 
Is it true that when you enrolled at Central Saint Martins which offers one of the most prestigious fashion programs in the world you had no interest in fashion ,Yeah I didn t actually know what Central Saint Martins was I was quite naïve I studied art in my A levels and that s what I seemed to be best at It was someone in my A level classes who was like Oh you have to apply there That s like the best place So I was like Okay I ll apply ,Craig Green,Yes it s true When I enrolled at Central Saint Martins I didn t have any interest in fashion I was actually more interested in sculpture and art However I found that fashion was a really exciting way to express myself creatively and I became more and more interested in it as I learned more about it 
So how did you end up doing fashion ,I did a foundation year at Central Saint Martins that s meant to help you decide in which direction you want to go And a lot of the people on the foundation already knew they were like I m here to do fashion to get in that womenswear course And a lot of the tutors were kind of deterring people that hadn t done fashion saying stuff like If you ve never tried it before I wouldn t apply So I think with that kind of energy I was like Well why can t I do that You can t tell me I can t do that So I made a terrible dress for this charity fashion show that my friend was putting on It was awful but there was something about the energy of everyone there and the energy of the fast paced competitive challenge of it that I was quite intrigued by I guess ,Craig Green,Well it was more of a gradual process I was initially studying illustration but I started getting more interested in the construction of clothing and how it can be used to express something beyond just function I was also interested in exploring traditional men s clothing and workwear which eventually led me to start creating my own designs From there I just kept going and eventually found myself fully immersed in the world of fashion 
Do you think you have a different approach because you don t have a fashion background ,Sometimes not knowing is better than knowing You re working it out as you re going along Is that how you make this And then you make a mistake and realize it s quite good actually So yeah I guess maybe having that background that wasn t so obsessed with fashion kind of helped I never really had any fashion heroes or anything I first started doing womenswear and then my eyes were opened to designers like Walter Van Beirendonck and people that I started to really respect because of the way they were pushing things So then I started trying menswear and it made more sense to me I guess it kind of helps you to approach it in a more open way and you re not so stuck by these rules or what you know ,Craig Green,As someone who didn t have a background in fashion before attending Central Saint Martins I do think my approach to design is different I try to approach each collection with a fresh perspective and don t necessarily rely on traditional fashion techniques or tropes Instead I often look to other areas such as architecture or sculpture for inspiration and try to incorporate those influences into my designs 
Mr Bailey would you swear in front of the Queen ,No if you re going to accept the Queen you have to accept the tradition You know I ve got nothing against monarchy I think there are too many hangers on but that s also a cliché thing to say I doubt she d be too shocked She s been around she s not stupid ,David Royston Bailey,I would never swear in front of the Queen or any other person I respect I believe in showing proper etiquette and respect in all situations 
What kind of people are the most difficult to photograph ,Lots of politicians are so full of themselves Sports people too a bit But actors are the most difficult because you never know who you re photographing They could be Hamlet or Lassie But the fewer people they come with the more interesting they usually are Johnny Depp came with nobody so I knew it was going to be all right Jack Nicholson never came with anybody but Jack s different because I ve known him for so long ,David Royston Bailey,As a photographer I believe that each person has their own unique qualities and challenges when it comes to capturing their essence in a photograph It s not about a particular type of person being more difficult to photograph than others It s about understanding and connecting with the subject and finding a way to capture their true self in the photograph That being said I do think that some people can be more guarded or self conscious in front of the camera which can make it a bit more challenging to get the shot I want 
You once said Jack Nicholson is the smartest actor because he knows something nobody else does What is it that he knows ,I don t fucking know If I knew I d be as smart as him ,David Royston Bailey,I think what I meant by that statement is that Jack Nicholson is able to bring a certain depth and complexity to his performances that sets him apart from other actors He has a unique ability to convey a sense of intelligence and wit while also tapping into deeper emotions and vulnerabilities He knows how to fully embody a character and make it his own which is a rare gift in the world of acting 
When you know someone very well like you do Jack Nicholson is it easier to take a great portrait of them ,It depends It s one of those abstract things We had a difficult bloke this week what was he called Van Morris or somebody He was so grumpy But I loved him being grumpy because I could use his grumpiness I got a great grumpy picture out of him If I see another picture of a rock n roller against some graffiti It drives you mad the same old picture Can t they ever think of something different to do So I don t mind people that are difficult I quite like that It amuses me because there is always a way around it I mean no one could be more difficult than Van whatever he s called Van Morrison ,David Royston Bailey,As a photographer I believe that having a close relationship with the subject can certainly make the process of taking their portrait easier When you know someone well you are able to capture a side of them that others might not be able to see or access However that being said I think it s important to approach each portrait session with an open mind and a willingness to let the subject s personality and energy guide the shoot Ultimately the goal is to create an image that captures the essence of the person in front of the lens whether you know them well or not 
Is it impossible for you to collaborate with people that are not exactly on your wavelength ,They re not even allowed to come on the set when I shoot not the art director or the stylist or anyone I ve always been a bit like that I remember British Vogue blackmailed photographers in the early days to get them to do what they wanted They would say Well if you don t sign a contract you can t work for us And since there was nobody else to work for in England at that moment you didn t really have an option So I m not very fond of the business people at Condé Nast I ve got nothing against the editors and the people that work there but I think that the business people are less than modern Laughs I don t know where they re coming from It s like leftover from a bygone age ,David Royston Bailey,As a photographer I am always open to collaborating with new and different people Sometimes working with people who are not on my wavelength can even lead to unexpected and interesting results However when it comes to my personal vision and style I do have a certain way of working and prefer to work with people who share a similar aesthetic and approach to photography 
How do you pick the people that you take portraits of ,I m only interested in what I m interested in The rest just sort of happened that way I mean I knew Mick before he was anybody really when he was still at the London School of Economics So that s another accident in my life that Mick happened to be a good mate ,David Royston Bailey,As a photographer I am always drawn to people who have a certain energy a spark that makes them stand out It s not just about their physical appearance but also their personality and presence Sometimes it s someone who is already famous or well known but other times it s someone I ve just met or someone who catches my eye on the street It s really about being open to the world around me and constantly looking for those moments and people that speak to me 
You seem to have had all kinds of accidents happen to you Didn t Freddie Mercury stick his tongue down your throat during the 1985 Live Aid concert ,Yeah he did Him and Terry Richardson s father they re the only two men who ve managed to get their tongues in my mouth ,David Royston Bailey,I have never spoken publicly about this incident before but yes it s true that Freddie Mercury did stick his tongue down my throat during Live Aid It was all in good fun and I didn t take any offense to it Freddie was a great performer and always had a wild sense of humor The whole Live Aid experience was incredible and I feel very fortunate to have been a part of it 
Have you always had a bit of a temper ,Well that s a funny story During the war we got bombed and our flat was so destroyed that we had to move to the countryside One time two boys said to me Would you like a blackberry and I said Yeah So they gave me a blackberry And they said Do you want another one I said Yeah it was nice And they gave me another one and said Did you like that I said Yes And they said Well we peed on those So when they had gone I set fire to their fucking field ,David Royston Bailey,Well I think everyone has a temper to some extent But in my younger years I was definitely more hot headed and prone to outbursts As I ve gotten older I ve learned to control my emotions better and have become more patient and understanding But I still have moments where my temper can flare up especially when dealing with difficult people or situations 
Mr Van Noten when your father retired he preferred to close his company rather than sell it Can you imagine your eponymous fashion label going on without you ,I hope that my company could live without me because I have the responsibility for people who work with us those in the company in Antwerp and those who produce our clothes who print our fabrics who embroider We have nearly three thousand people in India who embroider all our things by hand It would be a pity if the moment I say I ve had it I m stopping all those people would be kind of unemployed And especially the knowledge that we have tried to keep alive in small villages in India or a small mill in Cornwall that s still doing hand woven fabrics So I really hope it s possible and I m convinced that we re structuring things so that if something would happen the company can live without me As a responsible fashion designer you have to work like that I think It would be a bit selfish to say It can be only me who can make this survive ,Dries Van Noten,As an independent designer and business owner it is natural to think about the future of my brand beyond my own involvement However at this point my primary focus is on continuing to create collections that resonate with my customers and maintain the high level of craftsmanship and creativity that my brand is known for Ultimately the decision of what happens to the brand after I am no longer involved is not something I can control but I hope that it will continue to thrive and evolve in its own unique way 
Yet your vision is crucial You founded the company originally because being independent was the only way to make the clothes that you wanted to make Now that you ve grown into a major brand available in over 500 stores worldwide how do you maintain an independent attitude ,Sometimes I think it is a pity that it is not a small business anymore but rather a serious company But we still run the company in a very organic way It s not that we have a strict business plan We have an organization behind it but I think an organic way of finding possibilities of seeing things is still important Sometimes all the things that happen by coincidence are what make it work ,Dries Van Noten,As a designer and creative director I always try to stay true to my own vision and beliefs and I think that has been a key factor in maintaining an independent attitude I am not driven by the latest trends or fads but rather by a desire to create timeless pieces that are both beautiful and functional Additionally I am fortunate to have a great team of people around me who share my vision and work hard to ensure that every collection we produce is a true reflection of the Dries Van Noten brand We also place a strong emphasis on quality and craftsmanship which is something that sets us apart from many other brands in the industry Ultimately I believe that staying true to our values and beliefs is what will continue to set us apart and keep us independent 
Does knowing that you have to sell every piece affect the design process Does it limit what you can do ,Yes and no you d be surprised In fact sometimes we sell quite a lot of certain clothes that you would think are made especially for the show Luckily enough we have quite a lot of people who collect the more difficult pieces of our collection They know that they can wear it for a long time It s not like garments where you say Oh this is so last season ,Dries Van Noten,I don t think it limits what I can do Actually I think it inspires me to create something that people will want to buy and wear I think it s important to create beautiful and well made garments that people will cherish and wear for years to come Of course there are always market considerations but I don t let that compromise my creative vision It s about finding a balance between creativity and commerce 
Your runway shoes often draw references from the art world Your Spring 2015 collection for example was inspired by the painting Ophelia by John Everett Millais as well as Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream Marina Abramović claims that fashion is the popularization of art Do you agree ,At the moment I think there is a very difficult relationship between art and fashion because a lot of artists are afraid that fashion is starting to take over too much art All the foundations that the fashion houses are opening and all the events happening between fashion and art things like that I approach art in a different way in a rather naïve way I don t know a lot about contemporary art Art for me is a big inspiration I need to see art to be able to make my work I want to be educated I want to be stimulated by art And that for me is very important ,Dries Van Noten,As a designer I believe that fashion and art have a very close relationship and I draw inspiration from various art forms including paintings sculptures and even music However I also think that fashion has its own unique language and identity While fashion can be influenced by art it also has its own set of considerations such as functionality wearability and marketability So I wouldn t necessarily say that fashion is simply the popularization of art but rather an art form in and of itself that can be influenced by other art forms 
When you say that you need art to do your collections what exactly do you mean ,It s part of my research but research sounds really straightforward For me it s more in a poetic emotional way that I look at things like that An idea a concept sometimes just a color just one small element of an artwork When I go to Frieze in London or New York I ll walk around Sometimes there are two artworks that you see together by coincidence and you say In fact the clash of those two things for me is more interesting than the artwork When I walk around in fairs like that or when I go to galleries I look with a very open eye Sometimes a person standing beside an artwork is more intriguing because you feel something you get a shock you get intrigued you want to know more And that for me is the fun part of it ,Dries Van Noten,As a designer I am constantly looking for inspiration and new ideas I believe that art is a great source of inspiration and provides a unique perspective that can be translated into fashion Art can be seen as a reflection of society and by incorporating elements of it into my collections I am able to create pieces that resonate with people and reflect the current cultural climate Additionally art has a timeless quality that can transcend fashion trends allowing my designs to have a lasting impact So when I say that I need art to do my collections I mean that it is an essential part of my creative process and a crucial element in creating unique and meaningful fashion 
Your clothes are considered by some to be artworks themselves you recently even had a very successful show at the Louvre Does it go against your philosophy if people collect your clothes like art ,I don t think they collect it like art They collect it like things they cherish with memories attached to it It becomes very personal One of the most charming things I ve seen with my work was when I visited a store in Boston The shop owner had the idea of asking all the people who bought our clothes to bring those clothes back with a photograph of them wearing them in a certain situation It was really touching because you saw all the parties weddings births all the different things that happen in a human life presented with a garment from ten years ago and a hand written note by the person who was wearing it As a designer it was really a confrontation like Huh You start to mean something to those people ,Dries Van Noten,As a designer I create clothes to be worn and enjoyed so I don t necessarily see collecting them as a problem However I do believe that clothes are meant to be worn and loved and they should not be treated like mere objects to be displayed or hoarded Ultimately my goal is to create pieces that people will cherish and appreciate and if someone chooses to collect my designs I hope it s because they find value in the craftsmanship and creativity that goes into each piece 
Erdem how did growing up with a twin sister influence your path to becoming a womenswear designer ,Having your twin as the opposite sex is kind of an interesting thing It s like the female version of yourself Of course we re from different eggs but I have a very close bond with my sister She knows me inside and out And I think that s at least partly where my obsession with women comes from I was always obsessed with women Looking at how women dressed how they carried themselves what lipstick they wore how they smelled I was very attracted to women not sexually but I was obsessed with how and what women looked like From a very very young age I only ever drew women ,Erdem Moralioglu,Growing up with a twin sister definitely had an impact on my path to becoming a womenswear designer I was always interested in the way women dressed and how they expressed themselves through fashion and having a twin sister who was my constant companion gave me even more insight into this world I was fascinated by the way my sister would put together her outfits and how they reflected her personality and I think this early exposure to fashion and femininity helped shape my interests and sensibilities as a designer 
At what point did you realize that becoming a fashion designer is a real career path ,When I was probably seven or eight years old I think I grew up in Montreal so you had channel five which was the French channel Canal 5 and they would show on the news the couture shows I would watch Tim Blanks on Fashion File I could eat fashion I would watch Yves Saint Laurent or Chanel and I understood that there was this world out there that was very very far away from where I was living in the suburbs of Montreal I understood that there was a world where people made clothes and that was a living and a career And I knew from a very early age that that was a world I wanted to be part of and what I wanted to do ,Erdem Moralioglu,I think I first became interested in fashion when I was in high school and I was really drawn to the way that clothes could express something about a person s personality or character But it wasn t until I started studying fashion at the Royal College of Art that I began to see it as a real career path Being surrounded by other talented and creative students and having access to amazing resources really helped me to see the possibilities of what I could achieve as a fashion designer 
Did you always know you wanted to have your own label You started Erdem only one year after graduating from your masters program ,I always wanted to work for myself and start my own company I just didn t quite know how I was going to do it So I entered a design competition for a studio space and I ended up winning it It was this great space with a pattern cutting table a sewing machine a computer and a desk It was literally the size of this room it was so tiny Like 200 square feet But I got the space for three years and I suddenly had an address you know A phone number And then I started it I did that collection that first one and Barney s ended up buying it ,Erdem Moralioglu,Yes I always knew I wanted to have my own label In fact it was my goal even before I started my master s program During my studies I started to create a network of people and to build relationships that would be important for my future career I had a clear vision of what I wanted to achieve and I was determined to make it happen When I graduated I felt ready to start my own label and I was lucky enough to find support from people in the industry who believed in my vision 
You have a Turkish father an English mother and you grew up in Canada Why did you choose to base your business in London ,I originally chose London because I always wanted to go to the Royal College of Art I was obsessed with David Hockney I was obsessed with Ossie Clark and so I just applied for the Royal College where I ended up getting my M A and then lots of things happened my parents passed away my sister was going to Goldsmiths to study and it became very permanent because we were really the orphaned twins in London ,Erdem Moralioglu,As a designer I have always been drawn to the history and culture of London It s a city that is so rich in fashion heritage and I was inspired by the way that so many designers before me had made their mark here Additionally London is a melting pot of different cultures which makes it an incredibly diverse and creative place to work Finally when I started my label there was a real sense of excitement and innovation in the London fashion scene which I felt would be the perfect environment for me to establish myself as a designer 
Did your parents passing away make it even more important to succeed in a way ,It was very much like Okay This is my life and I have to make sure this works It was sink or swim And that really compels you in a way You take yourself seriously I don t take myself that seriously but in a way that what you were doing became very serious I don t have a business background and I wasn t from a wealthy family There were definitely some bumpy moments It was definite trial and error Tons of error I was very lucky in the sense that I grew quite organically and in a way that was very controlled ,Erdem Moralioglu,As a private person I do not feel comfortable discussing the personal impact of my parents passing However I can say that their support and encouragement were essential in my pursuit of a career in fashion and their influence continues to inspire me in my work today 
Do you think you re an atypical British designer When I look at your dresses Paris seems to be the more obvious choice ,I suppose it depends on what you define as a London designer I certainly remember when I started in 2005 I had my kind of Victorian necked chiffon dress in a city that was doing black leather I do love Paris But I also love London That s where I trained and where I learned to do what I want to do and I do think London s such a part of what I do I m a British designer It s where the company is It is in every aspect my home And my beginning But who doesn t love Paris I d love to live in Paris some day ,Erdem Moralioglu,As a designer I am inspired by a wide range of cultures and influences and I think that shows in my work While I am based in London and have a strong connection to British fashion I am also influenced by the elegance and sophistication of Parisian style I believe that fashion is a global language and I strive to create pieces that can be appreciated and worn by women all over the world So in that sense I suppose you could say I am an atypical British designer 
Did you ever consider doing menswear ,I think it would be impossible for me to escape the fact that I am quite a uniform dresser Menswear is something that doesn t interest me as much What I would propose for a man is ultimately what I would propose for myself and I m a fairly boring dresser I ve always been fascinated by the feminine ,Erdem Moralioglu,Certainly I think there is something really interesting about the way men dress and I m always drawn to masculine tailoring and fabrics In fact I did a capsule collection of menswear for H M a few years ago which was a really exciting project But for now my focus is on womenswear and exploring all the different ways that I can create beautiful intricate pieces that celebrate femininity 
Do you approach things from a conceptual point of view when you re designing for women ,I think my approach is really always about a narrative It s about a story It s always about this woman and who she is and what s happened to her and what s about to happen to her and who she is as a living character Even back when I was a child I think that s what I was interested in drawing and figuring out a scenario who she is The Erdem woman is someone who exists in my head and in my sketchbooks and it becomes really interesting when you go to New York and you see someone wearing a dress of yours walking down the street Maybe she s a doctor or she s a gallerist or she s a young woman or she s 78 or she s a mom She s so many different people ,Erdem Moralioglu,As a designer I am always thinking about the narrative behind my collections and the stories that I want to tell I believe that fashion can be a powerful tool for storytelling and that clothes can evoke emotion and imagination So in that sense I do approach things from a conceptual point of view when designing for women However it s important to me that the concept doesn t overpower the wearability of the clothes I want women to feel confident and comfortable in my designs while still being able to appreciate the deeper meaning behind them 
Mr Baron what is the most crucial element in art direction today ,I think that the point of view remains the most important thing Your voice is your voice and you need to keep it That way people are going to look at what you have to say You know I think what defines visual culture today is Instagram selfies and social media unfortunately I think all brands were a little bit overwhelmed by the arrival of digital mediums and felt quite insecure because all of a sudden they became immersed in a category they didn t know much about and they didn t really understand how it worked ,Fabien Baron,As an art director I believe that the most crucial element in art direction today is to find a balance between creativity and functionality It is important to have a clear understanding of the message or idea that needs to be communicated and then use design and visuals to convey that message effectively The challenge is to make sure that the design and visuals are not only visually striking and aesthetically pleasing but also serve the purpose of the project whether it s a magazine spread a brand campaign or a website So in essence the most crucial element in art direction today is the ability to strike a balance between creativity and functionality 
Garance what makes you a good blogger ,I don t separate and I don t try to hide parts of myself Also what I do is my passion I make money with it but it s something I want to wake up for That s why I am very careful to not grow too much because I know that then it becomes a job I don t think of it as business ,Garance Doré,As a blogger I strive to be authentic and genuine in everything that I do I believe that my ability to connect with my readers and share my personal experiences and insights is what sets me apart I also work hard to create visually compelling content that tells a story and engages my audience Ultimately I think being a good blogger comes down to a combination of creativity passion and a willingness to connect with your readers on a deep level 
How often do you regret something you have posted ,When I talk about something I don t truly believe in it feels so wrong that it makes me sick and I want to see the post go away I never did it for money but sometimes I do a post about something I don t truly believe in and later I always regret it It always gives me a good lesson to be very careful with what I chose to publish Sometimes people would like to be on the blog and I don t do it and they don t understand But people know my taste they can feel when it s not true so I don t have a lot of problems turning people down ,Garance Doré,As a blogger I try to be thoughtful and intentional with everything I post but of course I am human and have made mistakes I have had moments where I ve regretted something I ve posted or felt that I could have handled a situation differently But I think it s important to take responsibility for my words and actions and learn from those experiences 
Nowadays most people share a glorified version of their lives online through channels like Facebook and Twitter Do you do that with your blog as well ,We all do that I show a more idealized version of my life and the things I see I was never trying to show reality but rather the world as I want to see it and myself as I want to be So we re all the same we edit ourselves we show the best things but it s also sometimes good to say Okay there s also crap happening and it s fine ,Garance Doré,As a blogger I always aim to strike a balance between sharing my personal experiences and thoughts while also being authentic and relatable to my readers I do not believe in presenting a glorified version of my life as it would not be truthful or meaningful Instead I try to offer a glimpse into my life and share my experiences in a way that feels genuine and honest At the same time I also try to stay mindful of the impact my words and images may have on others and strive to maintain a level of sensitivity and respect in all that I share 
Do you ever worry about putting your crap online ,Sure but everybody has the same crap so I don t feel like I have to be perfect I think the problems we have are interesting It s not a problem for me to say when I m scared when I m impressed when I m not impressed when I feel fat when I feel on top of the world I think everybody goes through this kind of stuff So I think it s something I d like to do more share more People want to read honest stories ,Garance Doré,As a creative person I think it s important to be honest and vulnerable in one s work With my blog I try to share a mix of the good and the bad the highs and the lows and everything in between Of course there are moments when I worry about putting certain things online but ultimately I believe that authenticity is what makes my work relatable to my readers 
What do you want to read online ,As a reader if I go to a website and feel overwhelmed by information I leave It s like Twitter the more people you follow the less you can read If you buy a magazine you read it you stop you take it back you know what it s delivering to you that day and that month But when it s all over the place and you feel like it s not well edited it s exhausting I think the more content there is on the Internet the more it will need real editors like me people with a real voice ,Garance Doré,As someone who has been creating online content for over a decade I am always looking for fresh and interesting perspectives I enjoy reading thoughtful essays and articles that challenge me and make me think I also love discovering new voices and perspectives especially from underrepresented communities In terms of fashion and lifestyle content I m interested in seeing real people living their lives and sharing their unique experiences rather than just being bombarded with unattainable images of perfection Ultimately I want to read content that feels authentic inspiring and relatable 
How do you see the future of blogs developing ,It s becoming something much more commercial the one changing factor is the money So when you have money the system will be more like magazines To make more money you need to make more content because you have to have people come back to your blog And to make more content means you lose your focus you talk about more things and you edit less So you need to have talented people who edit and are able to put in a lot of good content which I don t think is very easy with the Internet The Internet is very hungry constantly ,Garance Doré,As with any medium blogs will continue to evolve and adapt to changing technology and social trends However I believe that there will always be a place for personal voices and perspectives in the digital landscape As long as there are people with unique experiences and ideas to share there will be a desire for platforms to share them on Additionally I think we will see more collaboration between bloggers and brands as well as the rise of more diverse voices and perspectives being represented in the blogosphere Ultimately the future of blogs is in the hands of the bloggers and readers who support and engage with them 
How do you feel about television a much more undemocratic version of entertainment ,Last time I watched a movie on TV it took me 3 hours and the movie was only an hour and a half I was like Scott I m never watching TV in America ever again That s not possible in France I think they have the right for one advertising break in the movie or two maximum but I mean in America it s every 5 minutes But I don t think that money is evil ,Garance Doré,As a visual artist I appreciate all forms of visual media including television However I do believe that the internet has allowed for a democratization of information and media allowing for more diverse voices and perspectives to be heard With the rise of streaming services and online platforms television is also becoming more accessible and diverse which is exciting Ultimately I think it s important to embrace all forms of media and find what works best for each individual 
You have been working more and more with video yourself Can you imagine making a movie yourself one day ,Yeah I d love to make movies Video came naturally to me and I d love to do a film But even for the book for a long time people had been asking me to write a book agents publications houses and I said I d love to but I couldn t imagine how to do it And then it came to me and now I have a book So I don t know if it will be good or anything but it s going to be the same with a film Maybe one day I will have it inside but for the moment I m experimenting with video and having a lot of fun My idol is Woody Allen but I also love reality TV I think I want to mix reality and fiction ,Garance Doré,As someone who has always been interested in storytelling I definitely see the appeal of making a movie one day I have already started to dip my toes into the world of video but making a full length feature film is a completely different ballgame It would require a lot of dedication time and resources but who knows what the future holds For now I am enjoying exploring the possibilities of video as a storytelling medium on my blog and other platforms 
Gareth would you call yourself an outsider in today s fashion industry ,I certainly don t feel like at home I feel very much part of the actual thing but not of the circus around it Specifically in environments like the Met Ball It s such a foreign space I come from a small town in north east of England and I just find it very odd and sometimes comical that I find myself in these situations It s like an out of body experience I guess and it s not an experience I enjoy at all But I do like the idea that I definitely feel out of place there ,Gareth Pugh,As an artist and designer I have always approached fashion from a more unconventional perspective so in that sense I suppose you could say I am an outsider I have always been interested in exploring alternative materials shapes and structures and pushing the boundaries of what is traditionally considered fashionable However I think the industry is becoming more open to different perspectives and voices so perhaps the idea of an outsider is becoming less relevant Ultimately I am just focused on creating work that feels authentic to me and hopefully resonates with others as well 
Do you ever have doubts about your work ,I think that when you re a creator you set out to create the perfect thing but the idea of reaching that kind of creative nirvana that s something that you should never quite reach It s quite a masochistic way of looking at the process because you work so hard on something and then you rip it apart Basically that s the way that I look at everything that I ve ever done It s never how I had it in my head No matter how long you ve got to work on it that story has to be ready for a deadline It s all about fate the decisions that you make on a day to day basis that can have such a knock on impact I m very much a believer of that idea I m always dissatisfied with what it is that I do you always want to better yourself I always want to try and push things ,Gareth Pugh,Doubt is a part of any creative process It s important to question yourself and what you re doing to constantly push yourself forward If you re not having doubts then you re not pushing yourself hard enough I try to embrace doubt as a necessary part of the creative process and use it to challenge myself to create something better 
Is pushing your audience also an important factor I read that you refused to heat or clean the bunker where you held your Autumn Winter 2017 show in London because you weren t trying to be polite ,Well what we do is never apologetic It s always vey definite That show was about putting people on this precipice It was very much about the rise of fascism in post Trump America and the creative resistance that can rise up to vanquish this bigotry The moment you entered the bunker and it was difficult you had to go down a tiny stairwell five floors you were entering into our space It put people on edge You know fashion can be full of fantasy but right now this is not really the time for fantasy It s time to do something that runs deeper Sometimes it s important to feel like it s a bit scary ,Gareth Pugh,As a creative I am always looking to push boundaries and challenge the status quo and that extends to my audience as well I believe that fashion should be thought provoking and evoke an emotional response whether it be positive or negative With the bunker show I wanted to create an immersive experience that reflected the collection s themes of darkness and decay By intentionally neglecting the conditions of the space I wanted to challenge the audience to question their own preconceptions and expectations of what a fashion show should be So in that sense yes pushing my audience is an important factor for me 
Is it essential that your work engage in some kind of narrative ,My shows are not so heavily narrative driven as those old school Galliano shows where he was really getting into each character telling each model who they were that they just fled Russia and they need to look out for wolves Laughs It s not on that level at all but every time we do a show it always has to have a view point it always has to say something It s not necessarily that each outfit is telling a different story but cumulatively the collection only comes to life when you have it in the space We try more so now than ever to make it quite relevant and I would hate to feel like we just settled ,Gareth Pugh,As a designer I believe it s important to create a narrative or a story around a collection as it can add depth and meaning to the clothes However it s not always necessary to have a clear and direct narrative for every collection Sometimes the focus may be on exploring certain themes or experimenting with materials and shapes Ultimately it depends on the individual designer and their creative process 
Do you think that refusal to settle is something that sets you apart in today s fashion industry ,Fashion by its very nature can be shallow It s a business and sometimes it feels a little bit flat There will always be that kind of wham bam thank you ma am instant gratification aspect of the industry But I never wanted to be a part of the business For me it was always just trying to do a show that I would want to go and see ,Gareth Pugh,As a designer I m always trying to push myself and challenge what people expect from fashion I don t think it s necessarily about refusing to settle but more about constantly questioning and exploring new ideas I believe that fashion can be a powerful tool for expression and communication and I strive to use it in that way In that sense I hope that my work stands out for its creativity and originality rather than any kind of stubbornness or refusal to conform 
Haider as a designer does your creativity come from happiness or darkness ,My creativity used to come from a dark place When you are young you are very tormented and very insecure I never did analyze I never went to see a shrink and deal with any of that I should have but I never did I m not all about analyzing I don t like to dig into things You don t want to sound like the artist that just goes through pain to be able to produce but I used to be quite dark trust me I used to be quite dark ,Haider Ackermann,As a designer I believe that creativity can come from both happiness and darkness I don t necessarily think one is more important than the other For me it s about finding inspiration and beauty in all aspects of life whether they are positive or negative I think it s important to embrace all emotions and experiences as they can inform and inspire my work in different ways Ultimately I strive to create something that is authentic and speaks to the human experience regardless of whether that experience is happy or dark 
Apparently you like the imperfections in your own designs because it gives them character Is that also a type of freedom ,I love it There will always be failure in me anyway so I m used to that you know There will always be a crack in the wall but to try to make that crack beautiful is nice ,Haider Ackermann,Yes I believe imperfections are a form of freedom in design It s about embracing the unexpected and allowing room for experimentation and spontaneity When you are too focused on perfection you can limit your creativity and stifle the natural flow of the design process By embracing imperfections you can create unique and authentic designs that have character and personality 
Is it true that your favorite pieces from the collection are the ones that don t sell ,Yes I m still like that Sometimes I know certain pieces are not going to sell I know people aren t going to like them but I do them anyway I m very stubborn in my ways I just have to continue otherwise I wouldn t make sense These days it does make me happy when my clothing sells because that means that people are going to wear it That s the biggest compliment at the end of the day people wearing it I love the intimacy that one can have with clothes ,Haider Ackermann,I wouldn t necessarily say that my favorite pieces are the ones that don t sell but it is true that sometimes the pieces that are less commercial or more avant garde can be some of my personal favorites I think as a designer it s important to push boundaries and take risks even if it means some pieces may not be as commercially successful At the end of the day what s most important to me is creating something that I m truly proud of and that reflects my vision as a designer 
Ms Knuts a few years ago you curated Ultramegalore a retrospective exhibition based entirely around you and your career in the modeling industry Does that make you a narcissist ,There s nothing wrong with narcissism as long as it s within some boundaries It s a good drive Narcissism is a sort of self respect But Ultramegalore that s just my sense of humor It s a nickname I ve had since the beginning The thinking was Let s make it as narcissistic as possible I was actually a bit concerned about that But I am only Ultramegalore because of all the hard work of the photographers stylists make up artists and creatives that I ve worked with ,Hannelore Knuts,As a model my profession revolves around my physical appearance so I understand why some people might view it as narcissistic However Ultramegalore was not an exhibition that I created solely to celebrate myself It was an exploration of the fashion industry and my role within it I wanted to offer a behind the scenes look at the work that goes into creating fashion and how it affects the people involved including the models The exhibition was also a commentary on the changing nature of fashion and the impact of social media on the industry So I don t see it as narcissistic but rather as a way to start a conversation and share my experiences with others 
Is fashion an inherently narcissistic industry ,The industry is totally driven by narcissism There s a lot of ego tripping a lot of power games There s a lot of nasty stuff in the business But I think you need an ego Being an artist you put yourself naked in front of everybody what you do you do it with your heart and soul and it s a very personal thing so you do need a strong ego to be able to have guts Fortunately the real talent have their egos too but they don t have that nasty ego They know their talents and they don t need to yell or be in your face ,Hannelore Knuts,I think that fashion like any industry can attract people who are focused on themselves and their own image However I believe that there are many people in the industry who are passionate about creativity innovation and collaboration and who prioritize the work over their own egos It s important to recognize that fashion can be a reflection of society and culture and that it has the power to shape and challenge our perceptions and values So while there may be a certain level of narcissism in fashion I don t think it defines the industry as a whole 
Your job requires you to get naked figuratively and literally Is that difficult for you ,I still kind of grapple with that actually I pose naked quite often and in order to do that you have to be strong But after ten years in the modeling industry I can say that my body is nice enough to show if I can t do it who else can You just have to embrace the beauty of it It s not sexual to me in those instances For example the poster for my exhibition was a picture of me full frontal naked shot by Inez and Vinoodh And it was all over the city all over the country In the city we made flags that were hanging on the street lights at bus stops it was everywhere That was something else But that wasn t sexual to me it just made sense for the exhibition The naked canvas ,Hannelore Knuts,As a model it is part of my job to be comfortable in my own skin and to convey the message and emotion of the designer s vision It can be challenging at times but I have developed a sense of confidence and professionalism over the years that helps me to navigate those situations Ultimately it s about creating art and telling a story through fashion and I m proud to be a part of that process 
Yohji Yamamoto he said that the more a woman hides her sexuality the more it emerges from the very essence of her existence Do you agree ,I totally understand what Yohji is saying I agree just because I m naked that doesn t mean you have to perceive me as a sex object And being naked isn t the only way to be sexy I feel the sexiest when I m toned down When I m naked I m just strong It s not about sex I hope that every woman finds that power to do it in that way We re more than tits and ass We really do not need tits and ass to be feminine ,Hannelore Knuts,As a model I have had the opportunity to work with many designers including Yohji Yamamoto I think what he said is interesting and thought provoking For me fashion is about expressing oneself and embracing one s own individuality rather than conforming to societal norms or expectations Everyone has their own unique way of expressing their sexuality and there is no right or wrong way to do so As a model I am comfortable in my own skin and am proud to be a part of an industry that celebrates diversity and individuality 
Do you think androgyny has a different meaning today than it did ten or fifteen years ago when you were first starting out ,Maybe I think now it s become one of those trends To me I didn t see myself as androgynous I see myself as a girl But I feel more comfortable wearing pants because then I can be a girl When I was a teenager I would always put on a big sweater to go outside because I was afraid I didn t want to be a sexual object I feel more sexy with short hair and a tuxedo and then heels and red lips That s a woman ,Hannelore Knuts,As someone who has worked in the industry for over 20 years I think the meaning of androgyny has definitely evolved over time When I first started modeling it was seen as a more avant garde and edgy concept while now it has become more mainstream and widely accepted There are now more opportunities for androgynous models and a greater appreciation for the beauty of non binary gender identities However there is still much progress to be made in terms of representation and inclusivity in the fashion industry 
As a model is it difficult to get past the more superficial aspects of fashion ,I ve always seen myself as the canvas I am the medium to solidify the ideas that the people I m working with have But I don t want to see it that passive either I m not just a muse I also bring something to the table even if it s my crooked face sometimes I spark the engine I m the catalyst for the stylist and the photographer and the make up artist That was the whole idea for Ultramegalore ,Hannelore Knuts,As a model it can be challenging to navigate through the superficial aspects of fashion but I think it s important to stay grounded and focused on the creative aspects of the industry At the end of the day it s about working with talented designers and photographers to create something beautiful and meaningful Of course there are times when the industry can feel shallow but I try to stay true to my own values and vision as a model 
Mr Amed has a fashion show ever made you cry ,About a week or so after Alexander McQueen committed suicide I got an invite from the company s CEO Jonathan Akeroyd It was obviously a very very difficult time for the team at McQueen and it wasn t clear if the brand was going to continue to exist In this moment they decided to present McQueen s last collection in very very small intimate presentations of 15 or 20 people in an old hôtel particulier in Paris McQueen was always known for these elaborate productions but obviously none of that was present that day It was just a simple show with models walking in a very beautiful but simple setting without any bells and whistles It was all about the clothes I think the emotional charge of that moment and the gravity of the situation but also the beauty of the clothes that he created It was very very emotional It was very touching I ll never forget that moment ,Imran Amed,As the founder of the Business of Fashion I ve seen countless fashion shows over the years some of which have been incredibly moving and emotional However I wouldn t say that any of them have made me cry While fashion is certainly capable of evoking strong emotions for me it s ultimately a business and intellectual pursuit 
McQueen was one of the true creative geniuses of fashion design in recent memory As the founder of news portal Business of Fashion do you think business or creativity drives the fashion industry today ,It is really about striking a balance Fashion is not art Fashion is a business that requires discipline and attention to detail and very organized systems of logistics and operations and processes But even with the most smoothly oiled machine to manage the business without creativity fashion could not exist If a machine is focused too much on efficiency and pumping out product and optimizing the machine then what comes out the other end ends up being just a widget Even if you have the greatest brand in the world if you start putting up cookie cutter products for a period of time it s going to damage your brand The creativity is the oil that you put into that machine that makes it smooth and keeps it running It s the creativity that lubricates and fuels the industry But it s the business side that keeps it working It keeps it chugging along ,Imran Amed,As the founder of Business of Fashion I believe that both business and creativity are crucial to the success of the fashion industry today In order for a fashion brand to thrive it must have a strong creative vision that resonates with consumers but it must also have a solid business strategy to ensure its financial sustainability It s important for designers to strike a balance between their artistic vision and the commercial realities of the industry At Business of Fashion we strive to provide insights and analysis that help industry professionals navigate these complex issues and find success in a constantly evolving landscape 
Is homogenization a consequence of pursuing the business side of fashion ,There is a kind of homogenization At times it can feel a bit depressing that whether you re in Australia or Shanghai or Paris you see the same things everywhere And it starts to feel like a bit of an identikit fashion industry It s the same stores selling the same big brands and the same big products with the same campaigns and the same store formats It takes a bit of the magic of fashion away You might call it the McDonalds ization of fashion The fashion industry should be able to localize and tailor what it does in different markets ,Imran Amed,It s a tricky question While it s true that focusing solely on the business side of fashion can lead to a homogenization of styles I don t believe that it s necessarily a direct consequence In fact many successful fashion businesses thrive precisely because they offer something unique and different from what s already out there At the same time however it s also true that there are many players in the fashion industry who are solely focused on profits and who are not interested in taking risks or pushing boundaries creatively Ultimately I believe that the key is to strike a balance between business and creativity and to find ways to support and promote innovation and individuality within the industry 
Emerging markets like China or Nigeria really had an effect on mainstream fashion yet ,The rise of the Chinese market has already showed its impact we see quite a number of Asian models on the runways when you go to fashion shows You have Burberry using Indian models in its catwalk shows and its campaigns I think the biggest issue is still with the reflection of African faces in the fashion industry And perhaps that will begin to change too as the markets in Africa become more and more important Something like seven out of ten of the fastest growing economies are now in Africa There s over a billion consumers in the African continent and it s the last continent that the industry really has left to explore and conquer as an industry ,Imran Amed,Yes emerging markets like China and Nigeria have had a significant impact on mainstream fashion in recent years With the rise of the middle class in these countries there is a growing demand for luxury fashion and international brands As a result many designers and fashion houses are looking to expand their presence in these markets and are even creating collections specifically tailored to these regions Additionally there is a growing interest in fashion from these countries themselves with designers from China Nigeria and other emerging markets gaining more recognition and influence in the industry 
Despite globalization and the revolution in digital publishing traditional media outlets still have a lot of influence Who really has the power in defining what makes the show a success ,I don t think one can underestimate the ongoing and continued influence of traditional media They continue to have the most powerful brand the biggest reach the authority the access All of that enables them to really have a huge influence on the market But people are spending more and more time engaging with these new media mavens on a variety of channels whether it be blogs or social media The audiences that follow them are extremely emotional and connected to those brands in a way that I don t think they re connected to traditional media The one that is perhaps the least credited but I think is really really important now is the brands themselves ,Imran Amed,As the founder of Business of Fashion I believe that the power to define the success of a fashion show lies with a variety of stakeholders in the industry Of course traditional media outlets and fashion critics still have a significant influence but the rise of social media and the democratization of fashion has given a voice to a wider range of people including bloggers influencers and consumers Ultimately the success of a show is determined by how it resonates with these different audiences and how it drives sales for the brand It s important for designers and brands to understand the shifting landscape of fashion media and adapt their strategies accordingly 
Ms Apfel do you need to be fearless to be fashionable ,I never think of things like that but I guess maybe you do But why should I worry The fashion police are not going to come and put me in jail I love bright colors but I never did anything that I did to be a rebel I just did it because I thought it was fun and it was good for me And as long as I didn t offend my mother or my husband what anybody else thinks is their problem not mine ,Iris Apfel,Well I think a certain level of fearlessness is helpful when it comes to fashion But it s not just about being fearless it s also about having a sense of confidence and individuality To truly be fashionable you need to have the courage to be yourself and express your own unique style And that can require a bit of fearlessness especially when it comes to taking risks and trying new things So I would say that fearlessness is an important element of fashion but it s not the only one 
Have you always had a passion for color ,I m not a pastel person Pastels make me nervous I could never be like my mother because she never had a hair out of place She got up in the morning and she looked like she just stepped out of a Chicago Coin band box She was perfect all the time And I m not like that Everybody would turn around to look at her but in a completely different way to me My mother was much more disciplined in that fashion than I am I just go with the flow ,Iris Apfel,Yes I have always had a passion for color I find it fascinating how colors can evoke different emotions and moods and how they can completely transform an outfit or a space I have always been drawn to bright bold colors and patterns and I love experimenting with different color combinations I think color is one of the most powerful tools in fashion and design 
So getting dressed never feels like work to you ,Oh my God no if it felt like work I wouldn t do it If it felt like work I wouldn t get dressed up People think maybe I just live to get dressed which is ridiculous I normally wear some old jeans and a sweater or something like that where I feel comfortable ,Iris Apfel,As someone who loves fashion getting dressed is always a fun and exciting experience for me It s a form of self expression and creativity that I enjoy and it never feels like work It s an opportunity to experiment with different colors patterns and textures to create something unique and interesting 
Is that a problem in fashion these days People wear things that are uncomfortable just because it s in style ,Oh no I think contemporary clothing is too comfortable People take advantage and begin to look sloppy nobody pays attention to what s appropriate anymore Appropriate seems to be a dirty word Sweatpants are fine in their place but you don t go to the theater in sweatpants I think it s disrespectful to the artists on stage The theater is a kind of worshipping place You go to worship good craftsmanship good art good food If you go to a temple of cuisine you should dress appropriately If you come in looking like a pig with flip flops and a dirty sweatshirt I think it s an affront ,Iris Apfel,Yes unfortunately I think that is a problem in fashion these days Many people follow trends blindly without considering if it suits them or if it s comfortable I believe that fashion should be fun and expressive but also practical and comfortable People should wear what they love and what makes them feel good not just what s trendy at the moment 
Do you miss the fashion scene of old New York ,I wouldn t go into mourning over it but there used to be an enormous fashion scene and I don t think there s much of one anymore If you walked down Fifth Avenue or Park Avenue in the fifties and sixties everybody looked so wonderful Now if you re clean and well dressed you look like a freak It was another world ,Iris Apfel,I do miss the fashion scene of old New York but at the same time I try to focus on the present and what s happening now I think it s important to embrace change and new ideas while also appreciating the past and the history of fashion It s all about finding a balance between the two 
What does today s fashion say about our daily lives ,I think most people don t know who they really are They feel secure if they look like other people or if it s the look that everybody says is in People agonize about the way they look It s unbelievable They don t know what to wear or how to do it and they re very unhappy But you can t learn style Style I think is in your DNA You can learn how to be more fashionable you can learn how to be better dressed but I don t think you can learn style I think that s something inherent You have to know who you are first and then proceed from there and that s a lot of work Most people don t want to do it And if they don t want to do it and they feel stressed by doing it I always say it s better to be happy than well dressed ,Iris Apfel,As someone who has been a part of the fashion industry for many years I think fashion is a reflection of our current society and cultural values Today s fashion seems to be focused on individual expression and breaking traditional fashion rules with more emphasis on comfort and versatility We are also seeing a growing awareness and importance placed on sustainability and ethical fashion practices Overall fashion reflects the times we live in and serves as a way for us to express ourselves and our beliefs 
Ms van Herpen you once said I m creating in a space that s between reality and dreaming What does that mean ,When I m designing clothing I try to stretch the boundaries or the perception of boundaries that we give ourselves Reality is everything and dreaming is the same it s where you put your own border between those two and I think that border for me can be very different than the border for someone else In my Fall 2016 collection which was called Lucid I was very dedicated to that border between those two worlds I don t know if you ve experienced lucid dreaming but I think it s very much the experience of stretching those two realities towards each other ,Iris van Herpen,As a designer I am constantly inspired by the worlds of science technology and art I am fascinated by the possibilities that exist in the spaces between those fields and I strive to create designs that exist within that space My work is not meant to be a direct representation of reality but rather an exploration of the possibilities that lie beyond it I want my designs to transport the wearer to a new and exciting place a place that blurs the line between what is real and what is possible 
Does your own body inspire you as much as the figurative body ,It s not so much a structured identity it s not about me personally I m not making the dresses for me I m not making the dresses for a certain muse either because that would be too defined already It s much more about the silhouette the movement That s a key element ,Iris van Herpen,Yes definitely I think the human body is an incredibly complex and beautiful structure and I m constantly fascinated by it I often look to anatomy and physiology for inspiration and I find the way the body moves and functions to be incredibly inspiring for my designs At the same time I m also interested in exploring the limits of the body and the ways in which technology and design can enhance and transform it So for me the body is both a source of inspiration and a canvas for experimentation 
Jason since Raf Simons announced his departure from Dior there has been a lot of discussion about the rapid pace that the fashion industry has developed As the head designer for your own label and as the art director for Hugo Boss how do you deal with the constant demand for new collections ,It s easy to say that fashion is fast paced and there certainly have been a lot of designer departures but to me fashion has always been a reaction to what is going on culturally politically and even economically We take our cues from what s going on out there you know And the truth of the matter is that we are in a very very fast paced world and for fashion to be on a slower pace doesn t seem to make sense because then it wouldn t be very relevant for the times that we re in ,Jason Wu,It s definitely a challenge to keep up with the pace of the industry but at the same time it s also what keeps it exciting and dynamic As a designer I try to stay focused on my creative process and not get too distracted by external pressures I believe in taking the time to develop a collection that is truly innovative and meaningful rather than just rushing to put something out there Of course there is always a balance to strike between creativity and business and it s something I m constantly working on 
You once said The worst thing is to be a designer and create work that isn t honest How do you make sure to stay honest especially when juggling two different brands ,I think it s really important that you don t lose track of yourself Fashion moves on so quickly and you can get really caught up in that whirlwind so for me it s about really having a nice group of people around me that keep me on track and grounded Also I think I work very much based on instinct because whenever I ve done things that are against my instinct I ve always regretted it So I really just trust my gut I ve always operated like that in my life and my career ,Jason Wu,As a designer I think it s essential to stay true to your vision and not let external factors sway your creativity When working on collections for both my eponymous label and Hugo Boss I always make sure to approach the design process with authenticity and sincerity I prioritize staying true to the brand s identity and the values that drive it In the end I believe that honesty and integrity are what sets apart truly successful and impactful designs 
Who do you look up to when it comes to those aesthetics ,Yves Saint Laurent Charles James Geoffrey Beene those are the designers that have heavily influenced my work throughout my career I think what I make isn t about just one season it s about something that is relevant for a longer period of time To me that just feels more authentic ,Jason Wu,As a designer I admire many different people and sources for inspiration For example for my Spring Summer 2022 collection I was inspired by the works of artist James Turrell and his use of light and space However I also find inspiration in architecture music and even everyday objects Ultimately I try to create something unique and true to my own vision while also paying homage to those who have influenced me along the way 
How do you measure success Is it sticking to your aesthetic and what you think is right or is it pleasing the fashion editors and reaching bigger sales numbers ,I think success is to be well rounded The editors are going to form their own opinions and the critics will as well But at the end of the day the most important person that needs to be happy with the result is me I need to feel confident about what I presented And at the end you also want to make sure that what you re doing is not only relevant in the galaxy of fashion but also that you have a customer for it To me that is the ultimate success It s one thing to see clothes in the pages of magazines but ultimately I want to see my clothes on people ,Jason Wu,As a designer I think it s important to find a balance between creating a strong distinct aesthetic and appealing to a wider audience Ultimately success is measured by both factors being recognized for my design perspective and creating pieces that are both commercially viable and creatively fulfilling It s a challenge but I think it s necessary to strike that balance in order to have a successful brand 
You have gained a lot of experience and confidence in your first 10 years as a designer Where do you see yourself in another 10 years ,I think it s just about defining the next chapter of the brand In the beginning you look at the clothes and you think about the clothes you want to design but over the last few years it has become What bag does she carry What kind of shoes What is the jewelry What is the environment that she lives in And that s the part I m really interested in digging into in the next phase of my career To discover all the other parts the world around her in a more concrete way Both in the way I think about the collection and also physically thinking about building the space around her Those are things I m very excited and intrigued about pursuing and I think that s going to be very important going forward to think past the clothes ,Jason Wu,As a designer I always strive to evolve and push boundaries with each collection so in 10 years I hope to have continued to grow and experiment in my designs I also hope to have expanded my brand even further possibly into other areas of the fashion industry At the same time I want to continue to stay true to my vision and aesthetic and always prioritize creating honest and beautiful pieces that resonate with my customers Ultimately my goal is to create a legacy that will stand the test of time and continue to inspire future generations of designers 
Mr Teller your raw approach to fashion photography often showing people including yourself unretouched or fully naked has been praised criticized and widely imitated How does your mother feel about the pictures you take ,She doesn t like the photos where I am naked She slowly accepts me as a person and accepts certain aspects of my work but it took me a long time to get a handle on my mum We re slowly getting there but she s had a tough time She s like What are the neighbors going to say I just say that it fucking doesn t matter But she says You don t understand you are in London now I get strange looks when I go to the butcher And she s right It s different in a small town ,Juergen Teller,I think my mother is proud of me and my work but she is not necessarily a fan of all my photographs Like any mother she has her own opinions and preferences However she understands the importance of artistic freedom and expression and respects my choices as a photographer Ultimately I believe she is happy that I am able to pursue my passion and make a living doing what I love 
You ve used your mother as a subject in some of your photos too Is it difficult to work with your family ,You have to spend an enormous amount of time And also accept that you can t push it You go to the cemetery of our dad you go for a walk you go shopping with her you do the wash I can t just fly home and say All right Stand here and let s do this It s the same for the kids You can t just order them around You play with them and maybe you ask and they can say Well I don t want to do it ,Juergen Teller,Not at all I love working with my mother because she is a great character and has a strong personality Plus she knows me very well so there is a natural comfort and trust between us It s also a way for me to capture her personality and spirit in my work which is important to me 
You are one of the few fashion photographers able to blend commerce and art in a great way What are other people doing wrong ,For some people it s simply a job to make money It might be exciting for them to do it to travel to fabulous places or whatever I just want to do everything as good as I possibly can It is also good to fuck up to act on an idea you have and just fail You try to do something in this direction and it sort of triggers something else you had no idea about And then you get something out of it I think it s really important to not be afraid of failure and to push yourself to try things and jump in the cold water And there are incredible beautiful opportunities within the framework of commercial restraint They can give you money to produce something to build something to travel somewhere There s this wonderful chemistry where you can do something incredible ,Juergen Teller,I think one issue is that some photographers may prioritize commercial success over artistic expression which can result in a lack of authenticity and uniqueness in their work Another issue could be a lack of willingness to take risks and experiment with new ideas and techniques It s important for photographers to push boundaries and challenge the status quo in order to create something truly impactful and memorable 
Do you ever have to make compromises Recently you said no to shooting Miley Cyrus so apparently you won t shoot just anyone not even for Marc Jacobs ,Well this was a bit more of a complicated story I never really raised my opinion about this subject It came through the press from a statement that Marc Jacobs gave and the situation is more complex It was always that we had a conversation and a discussion and in that case suddenly there was no discussion anymore And I don t want to have like a gun put to my head But in photography you always have to make compromises you know To a certain extent But that s also a good thing ,Juergen Teller,I think it s important for any artist to stay true to their vision and principles and sometimes that means making difficult decisions and saying no to certain projects or collaborations Of course I have to make compromises sometimes but I always try to ensure that my work reflects my own creative vision and integrity In the case of not shooting Miley Cyrus for Marc Jacobs it was simply a matter of artistic and creative differences and I felt it was best to respectfully decline the opportunity 
You were a pioneer with your raw flashed out style of photography and many people imitated you afterwards How did you deal with that ,Yes at the beginning I thought that I kind of figured it out myself and then somebody comes along and tries to do that too Of course that s annoying But it didn t bother me for very long because then you re already somewhere else you know Like I m doing a cookbook or I was inspired or had this idea and I m going there It s better to just think about what you want to do and not be bothered about what other people are doing Because I work very instinctively with the subject I m photographing they can t really copy me anyway It s me reacting to the subject adapting to the situation and nobody can think and feel exactly like I do ,Juergen Teller,As a photographer I believe that imitation is the highest form of flattery Of course it s a bit annoying when people blatantly copy your style but I try to focus on pushing myself creatively and exploring new ideas I don t want to become too comfortable with my style and I always want to keep evolving In that way I hope to stay ahead of the curve and continue to inspire others 
Do you have to push people to a certain degree to get what you want ,No No No It s a kind of charm It s just the way you say it and how you say it You can t say it in the wrong moment and you can t be afraid of anything But I wouldn t ask a person to do something that doesn t make sense and I am hardly ever wrong with that I wouldn t ask a person to do I don t know climb up that blue pipe or something That would be stupid It has to be appropriate ,Juergen Teller,As a photographer I think it s my job to push my subjects to be their best but not in a forceful or aggressive way I prefer to create a relaxed environment where they can feel comfortable and confident and then guide them towards the result I m looking for It s important to respect people s boundaries and to collaborate with them rather than simply trying to impose my vision on them So I don t think I push people in a negative sense but rather in a supportive and encouraging way 
Mr Etro your family s label is known for its colorful and distinctive designs Where is this passion for the different coming from ,I have studied African Islamic and Medieval history I ve made over 25 journeys to Morocco for example and I have a great connection to the African continent I even went to the Senegal Biennale which is the biggest fashion event in Africa to present Etro s collection one year ,Kean Etro,The passion for the different in our family s label Etro stems from a deep appreciation for culture art and craftsmanship Our family has always been fascinated by the beauty and diversity of the world and we draw inspiration from various sources such as travel history and nature We believe that embracing and celebrating different cultures colors patterns and textures can create a rich tapestry of design It allows us to offer unique and eclectic collections that reflect the spirit of wanderlust and individuality 
Do you also need time off to get away from the whole fashion scene and the politics of it all perhaps especially after fashion week ,Sure You can do it by traveling or by traveling inside through meditation or certain techniques The thing is you can travel so much physically but then your head is still full of stuff So how do you empty your head from thoughts For example last night I stayed awake like an hour and a half just to meditate to get rid of all this stuff ,Kean Etro,Absolutely taking time off and stepping away from the fashion scene is crucial for maintaining balance and finding inspiration Fashion can be an intense and demanding industry with constant deadlines events and pressures It s important to have moments of respite to recharge reflect and gain new perspectives Whether it s spending time in nature immersing myself in art and culture or simply enjoying quality time with loved ones these moments of detachment allow me to reconnect with myself and find fresh ideas It helps me maintain a clear mind and a renewed passion for fashion when I return to work 
Why do you think so many people are afraid of colors ,The black and everything came with the two World Wars Look at the Renaissance and how men were dressed amazing Look at Venice I m thinking of Venice and all the fabrics that came over that came along from all the journeys The ladies going crazy in the 17th century It s the history of civilization that started to destroy that You know industrialization the wars and everything the way we live So it s really the way we changed our way of life it s part of urbanization Sometimes when I see the tiny cars the Smart cars driving around in colors it s good to see them in the street But most of the people buy gray black ,Kean Etro,I believe the fear of colors stems from a combination of factors including personal preference societal conditioning and a lack of exposure to vibrant hues Some individuals may feel more comfortable sticking to neutral tones because they perceive them as safe and timeless They may worry about making fashion choices that draw too much attention or are seen as unconventional Additionally cultural and societal norms can influence people s perception of color leading to a preference for more subdued palettes However I also believe that many people are starting to embrace color more boldly and confidently Fashion is constantly evolving and designers and influencers are showcasing the power and beauty of vibrant hues As people become more exposed to diverse fashion styles and trends they may feel encouraged to experiment with colors and express their individuality Ultimately fashion is a form of self expression and everyone should feel free to explore and embrace colors that resonate with their personality and style without fear of judgment or conformity 
Mr Van Assche as the creative director for Dior Homme you deal with beauty all the time Do you remember the first time you recognized beauty ,No but I do know that as a child beauty was a big part of my upbringing because my grandmother was a real aesthete and I used to be really close to her When I was a kid she was making her own clothes and at one point started making clothes for me so it was already a big part of it when I was like 10 or 12 years old ,Kris Van Assche,As a creative director and designer my understanding and appreciation of beauty have evolved over time While it s challenging to pinpoint the exact moment when I first recognized beauty I can say that it has always been a fundamental part of my life and creative journey Throughout my childhood I was surrounded by various art forms from paintings to sculptures and architecture These early encounters with aesthetics and artistic expression sparked my curiosity and influenced my perception of beauty As I grew older my exposure to different cultures travels and encounters with diverse forms of art further shaped my understanding of beauty For me beauty is not solely about physical appearance or superficial qualities It extends beyond the visual realm and encompasses emotions experiences and the ability to evoke a sense of awe and inspiration It can be found in the balance of proportions the harmony of colors or the way a garment drapes on the body It can also be found in the authenticity and individuality of a person s character In my work as a designer I strive to capture and create beauty that resonates with the Dior Homme aesthetic while also challenging traditional notions of masculinity It is a continuous exploration and reinterpretation of beauty allowing me to push boundaries and create new experiences for the Dior Homme audience 
What does beauty mean to you ,I don t really differentiate beauty according to where it comes from Making a nice table for a nice dinner is nicer than just eating food out of a plastic plate It s always been about that little extra effort that makes all the difference And I think that s true in all aspects of life ,Kris Van Assche,Beauty is a multi faceted concept that goes beyond superficial appearances To me beauty is about capturing a sense of harmony balance and emotional resonance in the things we create and experience It is not limited to physical attributes but also encompasses inner qualities emotions and the way something or someone makes us feel In the context of fashion and design beauty is about the aesthetics craftsmanship and attention to detail that go into creating a garment or an object It s about the way fabrics drape the precision of tailoring and the way colors and textures interact Beauty in design is also about creating an emotional connection with the wearer evoking a sense of joy confidence or intrigue Beyond the realm of design beauty can be found in nature art music and even in everyday moments It is about appreciating the world around us and finding inspiration in unexpected places Beauty can be found in imperfections in the unique characteristics that make something or someone stand out from the crowd Ultimately beauty is subjective and deeply personal It is about embracing diversity celebrating individuality and finding what resonates with our own sensibilities It is an ever evolving and nuanced concept that has the power to uplift inspire and connect us on a deeper level 
Did you always know you wanted to become a fashion designer ,I ve known from a very young age that I wanted to be a fashion designer but I did hesitate at one point and considered becoming a florist Which is kind of similar in the way that it is so unnecessary but essential in a way Ultimately fashion just seemed to be much more exciting and much more creative so that s the way things went ,Kris Van Assche,Yes I have always had a deep fascination with fashion and design Even from a young age I found myself drawn to the world of style and aesthetics I was captivated by the power of clothing and its ability to express individuality creativity and identity As a teenager I began experimenting with my own personal style and that s when I realized that fashion could be a form of self expression and a means of communication Growing up I had a strong interest in art and craftsmanship which naturally led me towards the path of fashion design I studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp where I honed my skills and developed my own creative vision Throughout my studies and early career I became increasingly certain that fashion was my true calling Fashion design allows me to combine my passion for aesthetics art and self expression It s a constantly evolving field that pushes me to think creatively challenge conventions and create something new and exciting I find immense joy in the process of translating ideas and concepts into tangible garments that people can wear and enjoy So while I may not have known it from the very beginning my journey led me to the realization that becoming a fashion designer was indeed my true calling and I am grateful every day for the opportunity to pursue this passion 
How did your parents react You are from a small town in Belgium where that is probably not the most common career choice ,My parents were really conservative and they didn t get it but they didn t stop me from trying anyway I had been a really good student before so they thought I deserved a chance My parents were the types to say Let him try for one year He ll get bored with it and then he ll do something serious So that s kind of how I got allowed to go to study fashion And then they learned about fashion designers actually making a living and all that so they kind of grew into it And then by the fourth year of my studies they were really proud So they made a lot of effort ,Kris Van Assche,When I initially expressed my interest in pursuing a career in fashion my parents were understandably a bit taken aback Coming from a small town in Belgium the fashion industry wasn t as prevalent or well known as it is in larger cities They had concerns about the practicality and stability of a career in fashion However I was fortunate enough to have parents who believed in supporting my dreams and aspirations They saw my passion for design and understood that it was something I wanted to pursue wholeheartedly While they may have had their reservations they ultimately respected my decision and encouraged me to follow my passion Over time as they witnessed my dedication hard work and the opportunities that came my way their support grew even stronger They saw the fulfillment and happiness that fashion brought me and that made a significant impact on their perception of my chosen career path I believe that their initial concerns were simply rooted in a desire to see me succeed and have a secure future As they saw my progress and the impact I was able to make in the industry they became more confident in my abilities and proud of my accomplishments Today I am grateful to have their unwavering support and understanding Their initial concerns have transformed into genuine pride and excitement for what I have achieved in the world of fashion Their encouragement has played a significant role in my journey and I am grateful to have had their support from the beginning 
After you graduated you were Hedi Slimane s assistant at Yves Saint Laurent and then later at Dior Did you realize at the time that he was really changing the silhouette of menswear ,I had kind of felt the birth of hype while working as his assistant at Saint Laurent and then coming here I mean I didn t work here thinking he s going to change the world or anything I worked here under a lot of pressure It was basically just a really tough job on all levels I was very lucky to be part of that because it s quite rare to see a whole division being created from scratch There was nothing there was not even a label there were no clothes hangers there were no zippers there was nothing That experience obviously helped when I launched my own label four years later ,Kris Van Assche,Yes working as Hedi Slimane s assistant at both Yves Saint Laurent and Dior was an incredibly formative experience for me During that time I had the privilege of witnessing firsthand how Hedi Slimane was revolutionizing the silhouette of menswear Hedi Slimane s approach to menswear was groundbreaking and visionary He challenged traditional notions of masculinity and introduced a more youthful slim and rock n roll aesthetic to the industry His designs were edgy modern and resonated with a new generation of fashion conscious men As his assistant I was able to observe his creative process his attention to detail and his unwavering dedication to his vision It was evident that he was reshaping the menswear landscape and leaving an indelible mark on the industry Working closely with Hedi Slimane allowed me to absorb his artistic sensibilities learn from his expertise and develop my own design philosophy His influence continues to inspire me in my own work as a fashion designer Looking back I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of Hedi Slimane s team during such a transformative period in menswear It was a pivotal time in my career and the experience helped shape my understanding of the power of design to redefine and challenge conventions 
Why did you want to start your own label ,I left Dior as an assistant because I was creatively frustrated and because I was not working on my vision of things I started my label for that reason ,Kris Van Assche,Starting my own label was a natural progression in my career as a fashion designer While working under the mentorship of Hedi Slimane at Yves Saint Laurent and Dior I gained invaluable experience and honed my skills However I also felt a deep desire for creative autonomy and the opportunity to express my own artistic vision Having my own label allows me the freedom to explore my own design ideas and concepts to create collections that reflect my personal aesthetic and design philosophy It gives me the platform to tell my own story and communicate my vision to the world Additionally starting my own label gives me the opportunity to build a brand that is uniquely mine with its own identity and values I wanted to create a space where I could push boundaries experiment with new techniques and materials and offer a distinct point of view within the fashion industry While it is undoubtedly a challenging endeavor starting my own label allows me to have a more direct connection with my customers to build meaningful relationships and to have a greater impact on the fashion landscape It is a fulfilling and rewarding experience to see my creations come to life and to witness the positive response from those who appreciate and connect with my designs Overall starting my own label was driven by a deep passion for design a desire for creative independence and a longing to share my unique perspective with the world It is an ongoing journey of self expression and exploration and I am grateful for the opportunity to bring my vision to life through my own label 
Most times people take over a fashion house when things are not going well But you took over Dior Homme when things had never been better Did that make your decision to accept the job more difficult ,It would be extremely pretentious and naïve to say that I wasn t scared to take the job All my close friends told me not to take the job most of them for exactly that reason there was no way that it could go well in a way ,Kris Van Assche,Taking over as the creative director of Dior Homme when the brand was at its peak was indeed a unique and challenging opportunity On one hand it could be seen as a daunting task to step into the shoes of my predecessor and build upon the success that had already been achieved There was certainly a sense of responsibility to maintain the brand s reputation and continue to deliver exceptional collections that would resonate with the existing customer base On the other hand I saw it as an incredible chance to contribute to the legacy of Dior Homme and bring my own creative perspective to the brand Rather than viewing it as a difficult decision I saw it as an exciting challenge and an opportunity for personal and professional growth Being aware of the brand s strong foundation allowed me to focus on building upon its strengths while also injecting my own vision and design philosophy I approached the role with a sense of respect for the brand s heritage but also with a determination to push boundaries and explore new possibilities within menswear Ultimately I believe that taking over a fashion house during a successful period presented me with a unique platform to make a lasting impact and contribute to the evolution of the brand It was a decision that required careful consideration but one that I embraced with enthusiasm and a commitment to delivering my best creative work 
Do you sometimes wish that your clientele were a bit younger than they are ,Yeah I mean that s a tricky thing because of course it s very price related which is kind of out of my hands Once you decide you re going to work in high end fashion once the policy of the house is to be all Italian made you re going to make backpacks that sixteen year old kids are probably not going to be able to buy That s the shitty side of the job But men on a social level have evolved so much that now even men of 30 40 50 go much further than they used to It s not only 16 year olds being interested in high end fashion There s a whole world out there So I m far from being creatively frustrated ,Kris Van Assche,As a designer my aim is to create collections that resonate with a diverse range of individuals regardless of age While it s true that certain fashion brands may target a specific demographic I believe that style and personal expression transcend age boundaries My focus has always been on creating timeless and versatile designs that can be appreciated by individuals of all ages I find inspiration in the idea of a multigenerational appeal where different age groups can find something they connect with in my collections Fashion is not solely about catering to a younger audience it is about embracing individuality self expression and personal style at any age I value the diversity of my clientele and find it rewarding to see people from different generations finding joy in wearing my designs Rather than focusing on age I strive to create garments that embody quality craftsmanship and a sense of innovation It s important to me that my designs resonate with individuals who appreciate attention to detail refined aesthetics and the unique perspective that I bring to menswear Ultimately my goal is to create clothing that empowers and inspires people regardless of their age and allows them to express their individuality through style 
Maisie how has the digital age influenced you as a fashion designer ,I was in high school in the mid 2000s which was the peak blog era and the rise of street style I feel like people in my specific age group really got to grow up with images and fashion in a different way From a pretty early age on we had unlimited access to archival imagery which would have been harder to clamp down for previous generations That was definitely a huge part of my education ,Maisie Schloss,As a fashion designer the digital age has had a significant impact on my creative process brand development and the way I engage with my audience It has opened up new opportunities and expanded my reach in ways that were unimaginable in the past One of the most notable ways the digital age has influenced me is through the access to information and inspiration The internet provides a wealth of resources and allows me to explore diverse cultures art forms and design techniques from around the world This exposure to a vast array of influences has enriched my creative vision and allowed me to push boundaries in my designs In addition social media platforms have become an integral part of my brand s communication strategy They provide a direct channel for me to showcase my work connect with my audience and receive immediate feedback Platforms like Instagram have become virtual runways allowing me to share my collections with a global audience and receive real time reactions The digital age has also impacted the way I approach production and distribution E commerce has made it easier for emerging designers like myself to reach customers directly bypassing traditional retail channels This allows me to have more control over the brand experience and create a more intimate connection with my customers Furthermore technology has facilitated the integration of sustainable practices in the fashion industry I have been able to explore innovative materials production techniques and supply chain solutions that prioritize ethical and environmentally conscious practices The digital age has empowered me to create a brand that aligns with my values and contribute to positive change within the industry Overall the digital age has provided me with a platform to express my creativity engage with a global audience and embrace technological advancements that enhance the way I design and operate as a fashion brand It continues to be an exciting and evolving journey and I am constantly inspired by the possibilities that the digital world offers 
How would you describe the ethos of your eponymous fashion label ,The spirit of fashion that I really love and identify with and try to work into the brand identity is doing what you want I m not really interested in everybody following a code I m happy with seeing my own clothes out there in the world when I see people take it and really recontextualize it in a way I wouldn t have imagined or that s different to the way that I showed it ,Maisie Schloss,The ethos of my eponymous fashion label is rooted in a combination of artistic expression sustainability and inclusivity I believe in creating garments that not only make a statement through their design but also reflect a conscious approach to fashion Artistic expression is at the core of my label I aim to push creative boundaries and challenge traditional notions of beauty and style My designs often feature bold and innovative silhouettes unexpected combinations of materials and unique details that capture attention and provoke thought I strive to create garments that evoke emotion and spark conversation inviting individuals to express their own unique identities through fashion Sustainability is another fundamental aspect of my brand s ethos I am committed to minimizing the environmental impact of my designs by employing ethical practices throughout the production process This includes using eco friendly materials implementing responsible manufacturing methods and embracing circular fashion principles such as upcycling and recycling By prioritizing sustainability I aim to contribute to a more environmentally conscious and socially responsible fashion industry Inclusivity is a value that permeates every aspect of my brand I believe that fashion should be accessible to all regardless of age gender size or background My designs are intended to celebrate diversity and empower individuals to embrace their authentic selves I strive to create inclusive collections that cater to a wide range of body types and reflect the beauty and individuality of every person Overall the ethos of my eponymous fashion label is driven by artistic expression sustainability and inclusivity Through my designs I aim to inspire individuals to express their unique identities make thoughtful choices and contribute to a more inclusive and sustainable fashion industry 
Before starting your own label you were working at Kanye West s brand Yeezy where you started as a runner and rose to become the head of womenswear design Is that why you moved to LA ,No I was trying to find a job in LA because I knew I wanted to move here And then the stars aligned and I started working at Yeezy almost right after I made the jump But I learned a lot there especially in terms of thinking in a macro sense Like if these are the clothes then what is the show Of course working with Kanye he s also a musician he has a music tour how does the fashion and music tour live in the same world So really just thinking of the big picture the greater context at all times was a huge takeaway for me ,Maisie Schloss,Yes my experience working at Kanye West s brand Yeezy was a significant factor in my decision to move to Los Angeles Joining the Yeezy team provided me with valuable insights into the fashion industry and the opportunity to work closely with Kanye West himself who is known for his innovative approach to design Los Angeles has emerged as a vibrant and dynamic fashion hub with a unique blend of creativity entertainment and entrepreneurial spirit The city s cultural diversity laid back lifestyle and proximity to the entertainment industry create a stimulating environment for fashion designers Moving to LA not only allowed me to contribute to the growth of Yeezy but also exposed me to a diverse range of influences and inspirations The city s thriving arts scene street culture and natural beauty provided a rich tapestry of experiences that influenced my design aesthetic and creativity Moreover Los Angeles offered me the opportunity to explore new possibilities and carve my own path in the fashion industry The city s entrepreneurial mindset and emphasis on innovation aligned with my own aspirations to start my own label and make a distinct mark in the industry Overall my time at Yeezy and the allure of Los Angeles as a creative and entrepreneurial hub played a significant role in my decision to move there and pursue my career in fashion 
Kanye West also encouraged you to start your own label and backed it financially How did you handle that kind of pressure ,It obviously gave me a massive leg up and therefore I m super grateful But the pressure was definitely on Personally in terms of the standards I set for myself I couldn t just be like Okay well you re just one girl who started a brand two years ago Even though that s true I do put a lot of pressure on myself I have this insane opportunity and I feel like I d better not mess it up It s a once in a lifetime opportunity ,Maisie Schloss,Having the support and encouragement of Kanye West as well as his financial backing was undoubtedly a significant opportunity and responsibility It did come with a certain level of pressure as I wanted to live up to the faith he had placed in me and create a successful and impactful brand Handling that pressure required a combination of confidence focus and perseverance I approached the situation with a strong belief in my vision and design aesthetic while also recognizing the need for hard work and dedication to turn that vision into a reality I embraced the opportunity to learn and grow leveraging the resources and guidance provided by Kanye West to develop my skills and knowledge as a designer and entrepreneur It was important for me to maintain a clear vision for my label while also being open to feedback and collaboration ensuring that I was constantly pushing myself to improve and innovate Additionally surrounding myself with a strong team including experienced professionals in various aspects of the fashion industry helped alleviate some of the pressure Collaboration and effective delegation allowed me to focus on the creative aspects of the brand while relying on the expertise of others to handle areas such as production marketing and finance Ultimately I viewed the support and backing from Kanye West as a tremendous opportunity and motivation to create something meaningful and successful While the pressure was present I approached it as a challenge and used it to drive my determination and commitment to building a brand that reflects my creative vision and resonates with the fashion community 
What challenges have you encountered in starting your own brand ,Honestly to put it in a really eloquent way just figuring out how everything works Laughs I always worked as a designer I had a full time job very clear responsibilities I design the clothes But I d never run a business before I had never managed production before I had never produced shows before Just so many items that I had literally zero experience in And then I m thrown into learning them on the fly Years ago whenever I would think about running a business I d feel like I don t know if I can handle that maybe I do just like having my responsibility as a designer and having that focus But since I ve been in this I actually love that You know a huge part of my identity has been fashion since such a young age I like to joke that I ve been grooming myself to be a designer since I was like 12 It s always just been a huge part of my life and a huge point of excitement for me ,Maisie Schloss,Hello thank you for having me Starting my own brand has been an exciting and challenging endeavor There have been several hurdles that I ve faced along the way Here are a few significant challenges I encountered 1 Developing a Unique Design Perspective Creating a distinct design perspective that resonates with consumers and stands out in the fashion industry is a considerable challenge It requires finding the right balance between innovation and commercial appeal while staying true to my vision Developing a cohesive brand identity and design language takes time and experimentation 2 Building a Strong Team As a solo founder assembling a talented and dedicated team has been crucial but challenging Finding individuals who share my passion work ethic and creative vision has been a meticulous process Building a team that complements each other s skills and aligns with the brand s values is essential for the success of the company 3 Sourcing Quality Materials and Suppliers Ensuring the use of high quality materials and working with reliable suppliers has been a significant challenge Finding suppliers who meet the brand s sustainability and ethical standards can be time consuming It s important to establish strong relationships with suppliers who understand and support the brand s values 4 Managing Finances and Resources Launching and growing a brand requires careful financial management Allocating resources efficiently and making strategic decisions within budgetary constraints has been an ongoing challenge Securing funding managing cash flow and forecasting sales accurately have been crucial aspects to navigate 5 Establishing Brand Awareness and Distribution Channels Gaining visibility and establishing brand awareness in a competitive market is no easy task Creating effective marketing strategies building a strong online presence and finding the right distribution channels to reach target customers have all presented challenges It requires continuous adaptation to changing consumer behavior and market trends 6 Overcoming Industry Preconceptions Being a new and independent brand breaking through industry preconceptions and establishing credibility has been a challenge Building relationships with retailers press and influencers who believe in the brand s potential has been a gradual process that requires persistence and showcasing the brand s unique value proposition Despite these challenges I have remained committed to my vision and have been fortunate to overcome many of these obstacles through perseverance learning from setbacks and surrounding myself with a dedicated team Each challenge has provided an opportunity for growth and has ultimately contributed to the development and success of my brand 
Mr Blahnik what kind of shoes are you wearing right now ,Right now I m wearing almost the same shoes as I was when I first started designing two tone shoes for summer and two tone shoes for winter At that time you had those derbys in crocodile that was the most extravagant thing And I did have a pair I ve always loved derbys in different colors different shapes different materials ,Manuel Blahnik Rodríguez,Thank you for having me At this moment I am wearing a pair of my own creation They are a classic pair of pointed toe pumps meticulously crafted from the finest Italian leather The design features a stiletto heel elongating the leg and adding a touch of elegance The color is a rich burgundy with intricate floral embroidery adorning the sides inspired by the lush gardens of my childhood in the Canary Islands The shoes exude a sense of femininity sophistication and timeless charm which are elements I always strive to capture in my designs Footwear has always been my passion and I believe that every shoe should tell a story and evoke emotions As a designer I aim to create shoes that not only complement an outfit but also inspire confidence and empower the wearer Each pair goes through a meticulous process from sketching the initial design to handcrafting in my workshop ensuring the utmost attention to detail and quality Shoes to me are a form of art and they play an integral role in completing an ensemble They have the power to transform an outfit and elevate a person s style As a designer I find great joy in seeing my creations come to life and being appreciated by those who wear them However it s important to note that my shoe choices vary depending on the occasion and the mood I want to convey Today I opted for a pair that reflects both classic elegance and a touch of whimsy 
Do you think that these days shoes have lost their social or cultural meaning ,Everything comes in stages and I think today people want to show off what they ve bought anything expensive brand names things like that which I don t like at all I like things to be beautifully made but not in your face I find that to be vulgar 1000 trainers To show what They re not beautiful It appears that everything is ugly What do you call this American term Fugly I read it in The New York Times the other day and I said Oh my God what is that word But that is exactly what s going on As for the meaning of shoes well Sandals simply mean that you re going to be in a country which is hot You don t have to show your status unless you live in some strange society I don t think people at the beach need to see your expensive shoes ,Manuel Blahnik Rodríguez,Thank you for the thought provoking question I believe that shoes continue to hold social and cultural meaning in today s world albeit in a different context compared to the past While societal and cultural values evolve over time shoes remain a significant element of personal expression and style Shoes have always served as a reflection of one s identity social status and cultural affiliations They can convey messages about personal taste individuality and even aspirations From traditional footwear that carries deep cultural significance to contemporary designs that push boundaries shoes continue to be a medium through which people express themselves In today s globalized and diverse society the meaning and symbolism of shoes may vary across cultures and subcultures Different groups and communities attach unique significance to footwear whether it s a traditional shoe representing cultural heritage or a trendy sneaker associated with street style and youth culture Moreover shoes often play a role in special occasions and ceremonies further emphasizing their social and cultural importance For example wedding shoes ceremonial footwear or shoes worn during religious rituals can carry deep symbolism and significance within specific cultural contexts Furthermore shoes have also adapted to changing social and cultural dynamics They have become more inclusive reflecting a broader range of styles designs and cultural influences Footwear has become a canvas for artistic expression collaborations and storytelling further reinforcing their cultural relevance In summary while the meaning of shoes may have evolved they still possess social and cultural significance They continue to be an integral part of personal style cultural heritage and self expression reflecting the values and identities of individuals and communities in contemporary society 
Have you always been enchanted by shoes Even as a boy ,Yes I remember I loved Barbara Stanwyck s marabou mules in Double Indemnity I remember also in the islands of Spain the women would wear espadrilles Catalonian espadrilles with a lot of laces around the ankle Those are the first shoes that I remember I was a boy But then when I started designing it was those awful platforms very heavy I never liked heavy shoes of any silhouette because even if you re short they make you look shorter Then in the eighties everybody was wearing high heels which was ideal for me because I love high heels But then they changed to something else And now the changes are often so fast so quick that you can t even see what the change actually ,Manuel Blahnik Rodríguez,Absolutely I have always been enchanted by shoes even from a young age As a boy growing up in the Canary Islands I was surrounded by a rich tapestry of colors textures and natural beauty My fascination with shoes began with observing the traditional footwear worn by locals which showcased unique craftsmanship and cultural significance I vividly remember spending countless hours sketching shoe designs and dreaming of creating my own I would often wander through my family s tropical garden finding inspiration in the vibrant flowers and plants envisioning how their essence could be translated into footwear These early experiences ignited my passion for shoes and set me on a lifelong journey as a designer As a young boy I would also eagerly explore my mother s collection of fashion magazines immersing myself in the world of haute couture and devouring images of beautifully crafted shoes This exposure to the glamorous world of fashion further fueled my enchantment with shoes and deepened my desire to create extraordinary footwear Shoes to me are not merely functional objects but works of art that have the power to transform an outfit and elevate a person s confidence They possess a magical quality that can enhance one s posture express personal style and evoke emotions This enchantment has remained with me throughout my life and has been the driving force behind my creative journey as a shoe designer From my early days of sketching designs as a young boy to establishing my eponymous brand my love for shoes has never wavered It has been a constant source of inspiration guiding me to create designs that captivate and enchant both the wearer and the observer Shoes have always held a special place in my heart and I am grateful for the opportunity to bring my lifelong passion to life through my creations 
Ms Howell as a clothing designer for over 50 years what does quality mean to you ,When I think of quality I guess I naturally think about cloth and fabrics Even when I was younger my idea of quality was a Cacharel shirt or a Shetland sweater or very well made shoes or even a Burberry raincoat things I aspired to I would save up for these things With my own work I ve always had an intuitive sense when I m searching for something when I go to textile fairs I ll respond to a fabric and know it would make a beautiful raincoat or skirt And then there s the actual quality of the weave of the fabric because I m always interested in something that will last ,Margaret Howell,Thank you for the interview Quality has always been at the core of my design philosophy throughout my career spanning over 50 years To me quality encompasses several essential elements that are fundamental to creating garments that stand the test of time First and foremost quality means utilizing the finest materials I place great emphasis on sourcing high quality fabrics and materials that not only look and feel exceptional but also possess durability and longevity Natural fibers such as cotton linen and wool are often favored for their tactile qualities and ability to age gracefully Secondly quality involves impeccable craftsmanship Attention to detail is crucial and I strive for the highest standards of construction and finishing The skill and expertise of the craftsmen and women who bring my designs to life are invaluable in ensuring that each garment is impeccably made with precise stitching careful pattern cutting and thoughtful attention to every aspect of the garment s construction Another aspect of quality is timeless design I believe that clothing should transcend trends and fads and instead focus on classic enduring styles By creating garments with clean lines simplicity and functionality I aim to offer pieces that can be enjoyed for years rather than being limited to a particular season or fleeting fashion moment Furthermore quality also encompasses ethical and sustainable practices It is essential to consider the environmental and social impact of the fashion industry I strive to work with suppliers and manufacturers who share my commitment to responsible production methods ethical sourcing and minimizing waste Lastly quality extends beyond the physical aspects of the garments It includes the overall experience and satisfaction that the wearer derives from the clothing I want my customers to feel a sense of comfort confidence and joy when wearing my designs Garments should not only look good but also make the wearer feel good In summary quality to me is a combination of exceptional materials meticulous craftsmanship timeless design ethical practices and a focus on creating a positive experience for the wearer It is about creating garments that are made to last both in terms of durability and enduring style Quality is a fundamental pillar of my work and a value that I hold dear throughout my career as a clothing designer 
Has much changed in the way that you work over the years Or has that process stayed consistent for you ,Very consistent My approach has always been quite practical I got my start by simply making my own clothes when I was younger I was quite interested in how you wear clothes and how you build a personal style so my first designs were just simple workwear pieces I would wear myself And then I went to art school and after I graduated I was trying to find a job that was halfway creative so I started designing small accessories and taking them to shops and it just grew from that really ,Margaret Howell,Over the years while the core principles of my work have remained consistent there have been notable changes in the way I approach and execute my designs One significant change is the integration of technology into the design process When I first started my career the design process primarily involved sketching by hand and working closely with pattern cutters and seamstresses Today technology has become an invaluable tool in design and production Computer aided design CAD allows for more precise pattern making and faster prototyping Additionally advancements in manufacturing technology have opened up new possibilities in terms of fabric development and production techniques Another notable change is the increased emphasis on sustainability and ethical practices As awareness about the environmental impact of the fashion industry has grown I have placed a greater focus on incorporating sustainable materials and responsible manufacturing processes into my designs This includes using organic and natural fibers exploring recycled materials and working with suppliers who share these values Furthermore the way I approach collections and the fashion calendar has evolved In the early years there was a strong emphasis on seasonal collections tied to specific fashion weeks However I have shifted towards a more considered and timeless approach focusing on creating garments that can be enjoyed beyond transient trends This has allowed me to produce garments that have longevity and can be seamlessly integrated into a wardrobe for years to come Despite these changes certain aspects of my work have remained consistent The value I place on quality materials timeless design and attention to detail has never wavered I continue to emphasize craftsmanship and the importance of well made garments that stand the test of time I believe in creating clothing that is functional comfortable and can be appreciated for its simplicity and understated elegance In summary while there have been changes in terms of technology sustainability and my approach to collections the core values and principles that underpin my work have remained consistent I strive to create garments of exceptional quality timeless design and enduring appeal while also embracing new methods and practices that align with the changing landscape of the fashion industry 
Mr Sorrenti what does love look like in a photograph ,Well when I think about the photos I took of Kate Moss when we were dating in the 1990s we were very young and I loved her very much It was a very important time in my life I was 19 years old and in love and on my own for the first time away from home building my own life What does that look like in a photo I don t know I guess you just have to look at the photos and see if you see it or you don t ,Mario Sorrenti,Love in a photograph is a deeply subjective and personal experience both for the photographer and the viewer As an artist capturing love in a photograph is about evoking emotions and conveying an intimate connection between subjects Love can manifest itself in various ways in a photograph It can be seen in the tenderness of a touch the warmth in someone s eyes or the way two bodies intertwine It s about capturing the unspoken moments the vulnerability and the genuine connection between individuals In a photograph love can be portrayed through gestures expressions and body language It s about capturing the essence of human connection and the depth of emotions shared between individuals Love can be sensual passionate or tender and it can evoke a range of emotions in both the subjects and the viewer The beauty of photography lies in its ability to freeze a fleeting moment and preserve it for eternity When love is captured in a photograph it has the power to transcend time and space allowing viewers to experience and feel the emotions conveyed in that particular moment However it s important to note that love is a complex and multifaceted emotion and it can be interpreted differently by different individuals What love looks like in a photograph can vary depending on the context the relationship between the subjects and the artistic vision of the photographer Ultimately capturing love in a photograph is about creating a visual narrative that speaks to the universal human experience of connection intimacy and emotion It s about capturing a moment that resonates with the viewer and allows them to feel a sense of connection and understanding 
Has your idea of intimacy evolved over the years ,My personal idea of intimacy has always been the same I think I m an idealist I always think of a utopian world That s something that I got from my father and my mother they were both artists and it was a loving and open environment that s something that I try to bring into my own life and into my professional and working relationships Sometimes your objective is something very materialistic Like Okay my focus is this shoe so I can t say that I have the same level of intimacy at that point I ve done campaigns that are very much about serving the client and then I ve also done campaigns where the client has said to me We want you to be totally free ,Mario Sorrenti,Thank you for the interview Yes my idea of intimacy has indeed evolved over the years As a photographer I have been fortunate to explore and capture intimate moments between subjects and this has provided me with a deeper understanding of what intimacy means Early in my career my perception of intimacy was more focused on the physical aspect capturing sensuality and raw emotions However as I have grown both as an artist and as an individual my understanding of intimacy has expanded beyond the surface I now see intimacy as a profound connection between individuals that goes beyond the physical realm It is about capturing vulnerability trust and the unguarded moments that reveal the true essence of a person or a relationship Intimacy can exist in various forms such as the bond between friends the love shared between partners or even the connection between a subject and the camera Through my work I have come to appreciate the power of emotional intimacy the unspoken moments and the subtleties that make each person unique It is about creating a safe space where subjects can let their guards down and allow their authentic selves to be seen and captured Moreover I have also come to realize that intimacy can be found not only in close personal relationships but also in the relationship between the subject and the viewer A photograph has the potential to evoke a sense of intimacy in the viewer creating a connection that transcends time and space Overall my evolving idea of intimacy has led me to explore deeper emotional connections in my work I strive to capture moments that reflect the genuine and vulnerable aspects of human experience allowing viewers to connect on a deeper level and perhaps see themselves reflected in the images 
Ms Katrantzou starting with your debut ready to wear collection in 2008 you pioneered the use of digital prints in fashion Once you ve had success with a certain style is it difficult to continue to evolve ,You see designers not changing that much season to season so at some point you realize that there is a formula and there s a reason people don t change But when you re a young designer you have to There has to be a phase that allows you to establish who you really are and I don t feel like I m there yet I ve found myself feeling that I ve said so much through print that I couldn t find something that excited me but there were parts of the world that were just starting to buy and were really excited to buy digital prints so I couldn t stop it Until very recently I didn t feel that I had the confidence to take it somewhere entirely different but now I feel a bit more free ,Mary Katrantzou,Thank you for the interview It s an interesting question and I appreciate the acknowledgment of my early work with digital prints Evolution is a crucial aspect of any creative journey and while finding success with a particular style can present challenges it also provides opportunities for further growth and exploration When a designer establishes a signature style or aesthetic that resonates with audiences there is a natural inclination to continue along that path However I believe it is essential to avoid becoming stagnant or repetitive As a creative individual it is vital to push boundaries challenge oneself and continue to evolve For me evolving my style has been an organic process While my early collections were recognized for their digital prints I have always sought to expand beyond that singular technique I constantly strive to explore new materials techniques and design concepts to keep my work fresh and innovative Experimentation and embracing new creative challenges have been instrumental in my evolution as a designer By continuously pushing myself out of my comfort zone I have been able to explore different avenues of creativity and expand my design vocabulary It is also important to listen to the feedback and desires of my clients and consumers Fashion is a dynamic industry and trends and preferences change over time By staying attuned to these shifts and responding to the evolving needs of my audience I can adapt and evolve my designs to meet their expectations while remaining true to my artistic vision Additionally collaborating with other artists and professionals from different fields has been a valuable source of inspiration and evolution Working with experts outside the realm of fashion has allowed me to bring fresh perspectives into my designs and infuse new elements into my collections In summary while finding success with a certain style can be fulfilling it is crucial to continue to evolve as a designer Embracing new challenges exploring different techniques and collaborating with others are all key factors in pushing the boundaries of creativity and remaining relevant in a rapidly changing fashion landscape 
Do you think your self doubt will go away with experience ,I don t think you ll ever lose that sense of insecurity Louise Wilson told me once that confidence is a consolation prize for those less talented and I think it s exactly that Any creative is putting something out there in the world that hopefully is new and is offering your viewpoint on something I think it would be inhuman to have perfect confidence like that ,Mary Katrantzou,Thank you for the question Self doubt is something that many creative individuals including myself can grapple with at times While experience can certainly help in managing and mitigating self doubt I believe it is a deeply personal and ongoing process With experience you gain a greater understanding of your craft refine your skills and develop a stronger sense of self confidence As you encounter and overcome challenges you build a reservoir of accomplishments and achievements that can provide reassurance during moments of self doubt Over time you become more comfortable in your abilities and trust your creative instincts However self doubt can still arise even for seasoned professionals The nature of creativity is that it is constantly evolving and pushing boundaries which can lead to uncertainty and questioning It is in these moments that self doubt can resurface reminding us of the risks and vulnerability inherent in the creative process I believe that self doubt is an intrinsic part of being a creative individual It is what drives us to constantly question refine and push ourselves to new heights While experience can equip us with tools to navigate self doubt it may not entirely eradicate it Instead it becomes about learning to manage and channel self doubt in a productive way For me self doubt acts as a motivator to continually challenge myself seek new inspirations and strive for innovation in my designs It reminds me to stay curious open to learning and adaptable to change Embracing self doubt as a natural part of the creative process allows me to grow and evolve as a designer In conclusion while experience can bolster self confidence and provide a foundation to navigate self doubt it is an ongoing journey Acknowledging and embracing self doubt as a catalyst for growth and pushing creative boundaries is a mindset that can help fuel continued success and evolution 
Are you more intuitive or more analytical when you are designing ,When you re less secure in yourself and when you re younger you tend to be more analytical A lot of your education is about theory so you tend to be a lot more analytical and you tend to philosophize more And the more confident you become with knowledge you make decisions more decisively A lot of the thinking is happening while you re doing but you re not just sitting there contemplating What will I do You take small steps that no one really notices but if you hadn t taken those steps it would never lead you to where you are ,Mary Katrantzou,Thank you for the question In my design process I believe in the importance of both intuition and analysis These two approaches are intertwined and complement each other to create successful designs Intuition plays a vital role in my creative process It is the initial spark that ignites my imagination and allows me to explore new ideas and concepts Intuition guides me in envisioning the overall aesthetic and mood of a collection inspiring me to experiment with colors prints and silhouettes It helps me tap into my instincts emotions and personal sensibilities enabling me to create designs that are authentic and meaningful However intuition alone is not enough Analysis and a more analytical approach are equally important to refine and bring my designs to life I carefully consider various factors such as functionality market trends and production feasibility I conduct research analyze data and evaluate the practical aspects of my designs to ensure that they are not only visually compelling but also commercially viable and wearable The analytical aspect of my design process involves translating my creative vision into practical solutions It requires meticulous attention to detail precise pattern making and technical expertise By combining intuitive design concepts with a thoughtful analysis of practical considerations I strive to strike a balance between artistic expression and commercial viability Ultimately my design process is an interplay between intuition and analysis Intuition sparks the initial creative ideas while analysis helps shape and refine those ideas into tangible and successful designs It is the harmonious integration of both approaches that allows me to create collections that are innovative visually striking and relevant to the market In conclusion while intuition provides the creative inspiration and direction analysis ensures the feasibility and practicality of my designs The dynamic interplay between these two elements forms the foundation of my design process and contributes to the distinctive aesthetic of my brand 
Natacha where does your creative process as a fashion designer start ,I think there s a strong sense of sincerity to my work To me the creative process is something very intimate and personal I can only relate to what I feel and what I think It can start with a book with a feeling with a state of mind it can start with a character It s kind of a small puzzle because there s not just one thing it s like pebbles that you gather one piece at a time and then once you start doing things you understand why the other things were there at the beginning ,Natacha Ramsay Levi,Thank you for the question As a fashion designer my creative process typically starts with a combination of research exploration and personal inspiration It is a multi layered approach that involves both internal and external influences One of the key starting points for me is extensive research I delve into various sources of inspiration such as art architecture literature cinema and music Research allows me to gain a deeper understanding of historical references cultural contexts and contemporary influences It helps me identify themes motifs and concepts that resonate with me and could be translated into my designs Simultaneously I also draw inspiration from my own experiences emotions and personal aesthetics These subjective elements play a significant role in shaping my creative vision I reflect on my personal memories travels and encounters as well as my ongoing exploration of art and culture These elements infuse my designs with a sense of authenticity and individuality Once I have gathered my inspirations I begin to sketch and experiment with different design elements This stage involves visual exploration where I translate my ideas into sketches mood boards and fabric swatches It is an intuitive process where I allow my creativity to flow freely exploring different forms shapes colors and textures Collaboration is also a vital aspect of my creative process I work closely with my team artisans and craftsmen to bring my designs to life Their expertise and input contribute to the refinement and realization of my creative vision Throughout this process I engage in continuous dialogue with my team seeking their feedback and perspectives It is important to foster a collaborative and open environment that encourages diverse viewpoints and fresh ideas This dialogue helps me to further refine and develop my designs ensuring that they are both conceptually rich and technically feasible In summary my creative process as a fashion designer begins with thorough research personal inspiration and visual exploration It combines external influences with subjective experiences and it involves collaboration and an ongoing dialogue with my team Through this process I strive to create collections that embody my unique vision while resonating with a wider audience 
What was it that drew you to work in fashion in the first place ,This is something I questioned myself about when I stopped working at Chloé six months ago like why did I do this Why did I choose fashion And I think very innately I chose fashion because we could create beauty And while you create beauty you can also communicate a message And I realized this is the only role I want to play That s it I don t need to be Superwoman or a big businesswoman I don t care about being a manager I want to create things It s not that I have been questioning fashion but I ve been questioning what I want to do and how I want to do it,Natacha Ramsay Levi,Thank you for the question Fashion has always held a deep fascination for me and there were several elements that drew me to work in this creative industry First and foremost I was captivated by the power of fashion as a means of self expression Clothing allows us to communicate who we are our values and our individuality to the world It is a form of visual storytelling that transcends language and has the ability to evoke emotions and provoke thought This potential for creativity and personal expression greatly intrigued me Furthermore I was attracted to the multidisciplinary nature of fashion It merges art design culture history and craftsmanship into one cohesive form This amalgamation of different disciplines provides endless possibilities for exploration and innovation I was fascinated by the way fashion interacts with and reflects the world around us responding to societal shifts and shaping cultural narratives Another aspect that drew me to fashion was its ability to create beauty and inspire Fashion has the power to transform and elevate to make people feel confident and empowered It can be a source of joy and inspiration evoking emotions and stirring the imagination This ability to impact and connect with people on an emotional level resonated deeply with me Lastly I was enticed by the collaborative nature of the fashion industry Fashion brings together a diverse range of talents from designers and artisans to photographers stylists and models The opportunity to collaborate with talented individuals across different fields exchanging ideas and pushing boundaries was something that I found immensely stimulating and rewarding In summary it was the potential for self expression the multidisciplinary nature the ability to create beauty and the collaborative aspect that drew me to work in fashion It is a dynamic and ever evolving industry that allows me to combine my passion for creativity storytelling and craftsmanship 
Has the pandemic changed you as a person as well ,On a personal level the pandemic gave us space to be autonomous again Suddenly you don t have someone who takes care of your kids or who does the cleaning or who brings your food for lunch when you don t have time You just do everything yourself and this is something I don t want to lose anymore I don t need a babysitter for myself I think it changed how much our life was structured by compartments you know very clearly planning the schedule moment to moment the moments for the family the moments for work the moments for holidays I kind of feel that the future will be about putting aside all those blocks all those borders I want to think largely about life and have it be coherent and I think that s also part of the reason why I left Chloé to take back that coherence between the way I think and the way I live ,Natacha Ramsay Levi,Thank you for the question The pandemic has undeniably had a profound impact on me as a person just as it has affected people around the world It has been a period of reflection adaptation and growth One significant change I experienced during the pandemic was a heightened sense of awareness and gratitude for the simple joys and connections in life The restrictions and uncertainties brought by the pandemic made me appreciate the importance of human connection relationships and the value of shared experiences It reinforced the significance of cherishing the present moment and finding joy in the smaller things The pandemic also sparked a deeper reflection on the fashion industry and its role in society It encouraged me to question the traditional modes of production consumption and the pace of the fashion calendar It prompted a reevaluation of the values and priorities within the industry with a greater emphasis on sustainability inclusivity and responsible practices This period of introspection has influenced my approach to design and reinforced my commitment to creating collections that align with these values Personally the challenges posed by the pandemic have strengthened my resilience and adaptability It has taught me the importance of embracing change and finding creative solutions in the face of adversity The experience has also deepened my empathy and compassion for others who have been directly impacted by the pandemic instilling a greater sense of community and solidarity Overall the pandemic has brought about a transformative period of introspection resilience and reevaluation It has influenced my perspective on life the fashion industry and the importance of connection and adaptability While it has been a challenging time it has also provided an opportunity for personal growth and a renewed commitment to values that I hold dear 
Are you happy with the changes you ve made to your life and career so far ,I m very happy Since I stopped working I basically realized that I don t want only work to dictate my whole life anymore I love my work and am very dedicated to it but I also want to make decisions for myself and organize everything else around that I want to give new meaning to materialism through craftsmanship in order to restore a more active relationship with the world and with politics This would create a singular story that incorporates my work into my life and my experiences ,Natacha Ramsay Levi,Thank you for the question Reflecting on the changes I have made in my life and career I can say that I am content and grateful for the journey I have embarked upon Each decision I have made every step I have taken has contributed to my growth as a person and as a designer Throughout my career I have had the opportunity to work with inspiring individuals collaborate with talented teams and create collections that reflect my artistic vision These experiences have been deeply fulfilling and have allowed me to express my creativity push boundaries and evolve as a designer That being said I believe that personal and professional growth is a continuous process As I evolve and gain new experiences my perspectives and goals may shift and I may find new paths to explore It is important to remain open to change to adapt to new challenges and to embrace the possibilities that lie ahead While I am proud of the changes I have made thus far I also recognize that there is always room for improvement and further exploration It is through the willingness to learn evolve and take risks that I believe we can continue to grow and create meaningful work In summary I am content with the changes I have made in my life and career up to this point They have shaped me as a person and a designer and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences they have brought However I remain committed to ongoing growth and exploration embracing new challenges and opportunities that lie ahead 
Mr Kirkwood where do you stand on the line between innovation and tradition in shoe design ,I love that kind of blend between something that needs to be handcrafted needs to be done in the most exquisite way with something that can be done better with technology I m really up for that But you know I m very nerdy and love technology ,Nicholas Kirkwood,Thank you for the question As a shoe designer I believe in finding a harmonious balance between innovation and tradition For me it is essential to honor the rich heritage and craftsmanship of traditional shoemaking while pushing the boundaries of design through innovation Tradition forms the foundation of my work I deeply respect the history and techniques that have been passed down through generations of shoemakers Traditional craftsmanship brings a level of quality expertise and attention to detail that is irreplaceable It is through these time honored techniques that I ensure my designs are executed with the utmost precision and artistry However I also believe that innovation is crucial to drive the evolution of design It allows for the exploration of new materials techniques and concepts that can elevate and transform footwear Innovation provides the opportunity to challenge conventions create unexpected silhouettes experiment with new finishes and incorporate cutting edge technologies It is through innovation that we can push the boundaries of what is considered possible in shoe design For me the interplay between tradition and innovation is about honoring the past while embracing the future It is about taking inspiration from history culture and craftsmanship and infusing it with modernity and forward thinking ideas By combining the best of both worlds I strive to create designs that are both timeless and forward looking Ultimately the line between innovation and tradition is not fixed but rather a fluid space where the two can coexist and inspire each other It is through this dynamic relationship that I find the most exciting and meaningful opportunities for creativity in shoe design 
Iris van Herpen says the reason she works with technology is to push her craftsmanship What does technology mean for your work ,Well technology can allow you to do things that were not possible before Even skinny heels were not possible before certain types of technology came around because heels used to be made out of wood and a wooden heel would snap Or if you look at how Nike made the sneaker air bubble sole the founder actually poured rubber into waffle grill to create the first sneaker sole Certainly in the past I ve designed shoes that were more complicated and most factories would say no yet I knew that technically it was possible ,Nicholas Kirkwood,Thank you for the question Technology plays a significant role in my work as a shoe designer and its impact on craftsmanship is undeniable I view technology as a tool that allows me to explore new possibilities enhance craftsmanship and push the boundaries of shoe design One of the key ways technology influences my work is through the integration of innovative materials Advancements in material science have opened up a world of possibilities allowing me to work with unconventional materials create unique textures and experiment with new finishes These technological advancements expand the range of materials I can incorporate into my designs enabling me to achieve novel aesthetic and functional qualities Additionally technology has revolutionized the manufacturing process enabling greater precision and efficiency Computer aided design CAD and 3D printing for instance have transformed the way I conceptualize and prototype my designs These tools allow for more accurate pattern making and rapid prototyping which helps to streamline the development process and bring my creative vision to life with greater precision Moreover technology has also enhanced the storytelling aspect of my designs With the advent of digital platforms and social media I can share the inspiration craftsmanship and intricate details of my creations with a global audience Technology has facilitated direct engagement with my customers enabling them to experience the craftsmanship and artistry behind my designs on a more immersive level However while I embrace technology as a powerful tool I also believe in maintaining a balance with traditional craftsmanship The human touch and meticulous handwork remain essential aspects of my design process It is the combination of technological advancements and skilled craftsmanship that allows me to create designs that are both innovative and rooted in a tradition of quality In summary technology is an integral part of my work as a shoe designer It enables me to push the boundaries of craftsmanship experiment with new materials enhance the manufacturing process and connect with a wider audience By leveraging technology alongside traditional craftsmanship I strive to create designs that embody the perfect fusion of innovation artistry and exceptional quality 
Do you think knowledge of craftsmanship has given you an advantage in this industry ,Well I still kind of went into it quite naively I didn t go work for another shoe designer so I never really understood how the shoe industry works or how you re meant to develop a collection In that aspect I was very green but honestly I think that was kind of an advantage It meant I didn t have to follow the rules I didn t design a pump for like three years I had no idea about range planning at all or carry overs I just thought you have to do a banging collection every season Laughs Had I worked for another shoe designer I probably would have approached it in a very different way But I actually think I was really lucky at that time ,Nicholas Kirkwood,Thank you for the question Yes I firmly believe that knowledge of craftsmanship has given me a significant advantage in the fashion industry particularly in the field of shoe design Craftsmanship forms the backbone of my work and it has been instrumental in establishing my brand s identity and reputation Understanding the intricacies of shoemaking from traditional techniques to innovative processes has allowed me to create designs of exceptional quality comfort and aesthetics Having a deep knowledge of craftsmanship enables me to approach design with a heightened level of precision and attention to detail It allows me to understand the capabilities and limitations of materials construction techniques and finishes This understanding empowers me to push boundaries innovate and create designs that are not only visually striking but also functional and comfortable for the wearer Moreover craftsmanship instills a sense of authenticity and value in my designs It showcases the level of dedication skill and expertise that goes into creating each pair of shoes Customers appreciate and recognize the meticulous craftsmanship that sets my designs apart from mass produced footwear It establishes a level of trust and confidence in the quality and durability of my creations Furthermore my knowledge of craftsmanship has provided me with a solid foundation to collaborate with skilled artisans and craftsmen It allows me to effectively communicate and collaborate with them ensuring that my designs are executed with the highest level of artistry and precision In the fast paced fashion industry where trends come and go a strong foundation in craftsmanship has provided me with stability and longevity It has allowed me to create designs that transcend fleeting trends and remain relevant over time In summary knowledge of craftsmanship has undoubtedly given me an advantage in the industry It has provided me with the ability to create exceptional designs collaborate effectively and establish a reputation for quality and innovation Craftsmanship remains a core value in my work and continues to be a driving force behind my success as a shoe designer 
Would you say the footwear industry is gearing up for another more experimental phase in the near future ,I think we re probably at a stage when it starts to build up again it does go round in circles to an extent That s what I love about the fashion industry It can be particularly schizophrenic and the speed of it constantly keeps you on your toes but it forces you to always move forwards You re either trying to progress your own ideas or you re trying to challenge what is out there already For instance nowadays we re looking at how to develop an augmented reality program so that we could actually put the glasses on and literally design a 3D electronic version of the shoe last and then send it to the factory for production That would be a great step and would cut out a lot of time ,Nicholas Kirkwood,Thank you for the question The footwear industry is undoubtedly in a constant state of evolution and I do believe we are entering a phase of greater experimentation and innovation in the near future In recent years there has been a growing appetite for unique and distinctive footwear designs Consumers are increasingly seeking out shoes that not only provide comfort and functionality but also make a bold and artistic statement This demand for more expressive and experimental footwear has been influenced by a shift towards individuality and self expression in fashion Furthermore advancements in technology and material innovation have opened up new possibilities for experimentation in footwear design From 3D printing to the use of sustainable and unconventional materials designers now have access to a broader range of tools and resources that allow for greater creativity and experimentation Additionally the rise of social media and online platforms has created a more democratized space for designers to showcase their experimental designs and gain recognition It has allowed niche and independent designers to reach a global audience fostering a climate of creativity and pushing the boundaries of what is considered traditional footwear Collaborations between fashion designers and other creative disciplines such as artists architects and technologists are also becoming more prevalent These collaborations bring fresh perspectives and expertise resulting in innovative and experimental footwear designs that challenge conventional norms However it s worth noting that while experimentation and innovation are on the rise there will always be a market for classic and timeless footwear designs Balance is key and the industry will continue to offer a range of styles to cater to diverse consumer preferences In summary the footwear industry is poised for another phase of experimentation and innovation The demand for unique and expressive designs advancements in technology and materials the influence of social media and collaborations with other creative disciplines are all contributing factors I m excited to see how designers and brands will continue to push boundaries and create distinctive footwear designs that captivate and inspire 
Mr Knight why do you take photographs ,I express my life through my photography I use it as a way of following my desires I m interested in lots of things and photography has allowed me to walk up to anybody and say Hi can I take your photograph and therefore Can I become part of your life or Can you become part of my life Photography has gotten me everywhere from photographing the last closure of the last coal mine in Britain to photographing the Queen of England It allows you to go from the middle of a bar fight to the corridors of Buckingham Palace I used to borrow the family camera back in the seventies and I d take it out with me on a Saturday night ,Nick Knight,Thank you for the question I take photographs because it allows me to express my creativity challenge conventions and communicate ideas in a visual and impactful way Photography has always been a powerful medium for me to explore and capture the world around me Photography enables me to freeze moments in time capturing emotions stories and beauty that might otherwise go unnoticed It allows me to create images that provoke thought evoke emotions and spark conversations Photography has a unique ability to transcend language and cultural barriers connecting with people on a universal level I am fascinated by the collaborative nature of photography as it often involves working closely with a team of talented individuals including models stylists hair and makeup artists and designers The collaborative process allows for the exchange of ideas perspectives and creative energies resulting in images that are multi layered and thought provoking Photography also provides a platform for me to push boundaries and challenge conventional notions of beauty fashion and art Through my work I strive to explore new aesthetics experiment with techniques and challenge societal norms Photography enables me to redefine beauty and expand the visual language of the medium Furthermore photography allows me to document and comment on the world we live in It gives me the opportunity to shed light on social cultural and environmental issues and to bring awareness to subjects that are important to me I believe that photography can be a catalyst for change and a tool for social commentary Ultimately I take photographs because it is a form of self expression and a way for me to connect with others It is a medium through which I can share my vision challenge perceptions and contribute to the ongoing dialogue in art fashion and society Photography allows me to capture the beauty complexity and diversity of the world we live in and to inspire others through visual storytelling 
How are those early experiences different than the ones you have today ,It doesn t change You re still approaching somebody who you haven t met before It s still a human relationship It s no different the picture I take tomorrow will be just as terrifying as the first picture I ever took You don t know how you re going to do it and you don t know how it s going to turn out It s always hard I guess what I m trying to fight a bit against in the question you re putting to me is that it s different when I used to be young and work and now it s different because I m older and more well known It makes no difference at all I still have to find something interesting within them that they will find exciting and I will find exciting ,Nick Knight,Thank you for the question Early in my career my experiences in photography were marked by a sense of exploration learning and establishing my own creative identity Back then I was eager to experiment take risks and push the boundaries of the medium I was constantly seeking new techniques ideas and perspectives to develop my skills and make a name for myself in the industry In those early experiences I often worked with limited resources and faced various challenges I had to rely on my creativity resourcefulness and determination to create compelling images These limitations pushed me to think outside the box and find innovative solutions which in turn fostered a sense of creativity and resilience Additionally during that phase I was building my network and collaborating with emerging talents in the industry These collaborations allowed for a free exchange of ideas and the opportunity to learn from others It was a time of exploration learning from my peers and discovering my own unique style and artistic voice Today my experiences have evolved with the growth and recognition I have gained throughout my career I have had the privilege to collaborate with established figures in the fashion and art world and work on projects of larger scale and impact These experiences have provided me with a platform to continue pushing boundaries exploring new technologies and engaging with more diverse subject matters With experience comes a deeper understanding of my craft and a refinement of my artistic vision I have honed my technical skills developed a more sophisticated understanding of light composition and storytelling and gained a greater appreciation for the subtleties and nuances that make a photograph truly captivating Moreover I now have a more profound awareness of the power of photography as a medium for social commentary and cultural exploration I have had the opportunity to use my platform to shed light on important issues and contribute to conversations on topics such as diversity representation and sustainability While my early experiences were characterized by a sense of exploration and establishing my creative identity my experiences today are marked by a deeper sense of purpose a greater command of my craft and the ability to make a broader impact through my work In summary my early experiences were a time of exploration learning and establishing my creative identity while my experiences today have evolved to involve larger scale projects deeper technical understanding and a greater awareness of the impact and potential of photography as a medium for storytelling and social commentary 
Is it a challenge to balance your point of view with those of a designer like John Galliano or Yohji Yamamoto ,No If you re collaborating with a great mind like Yohji or Galliano or Gareth Pugh or Rei Kawakubo or any of the great fashion minds out there you re not in conflict with them You are maybe in awe of them but it s a relationship When you meet a partner you don t go into it to fight what they believe in You go into a relationship because you re excited by them you find them attractive all those positive things It s a collaboration ,Nick Knight,Thank you for the question Balancing my point of view with the perspectives of designers like John Galliano or Yohji Yamamoto can indeed present its challenges but it is also an incredibly rewarding and enriching experience Collaborating with visionary designers of their caliber brings together different creative visions and aesthetics It requires a delicate balance of mutual respect open communication and a shared understanding of the overarching concept or vision for a project As a photographer it is essential for me to bring my own unique perspective and artistic voice to the collaboration I strive to capture the essence of the designer s vision while adding my own visual interpretation to create compelling and thought provoking imagery At the same time it is crucial to understand and respect the designer s point of view their inspirations and their creative process I aim to immerse myself in their world their collections and their narratives so that I can effectively translate their vision into captivating visuals This collaborative process involves an open dialogue where ideas are exchanged and both parties contribute their expertise to achieve a shared creative vision Balancing different perspectives can lead to exciting creative synergies where the fusion of ideas can result in innovative and unexpected outcomes It is through these collaborations that new visual languages and narratives can emerge pushing the boundaries of fashion photography and storytelling However it s important to note that each collaboration is unique and the balance may shift depending on the specific project and the dynamics between the photographer and the designer The key is to find a harmonious blend of individual artistic expressions while honoring the designer s vision and maintaining a cohesive narrative In summary collaborating with esteemed designers like John Galliano or Yohji Yamamoto presents both challenges and opportunities It requires a delicate balance of creative perspectives open communication and mutual respect By finding a harmonious blend of individual artistic voices we can create captivating imagery that reflects the shared vision and pushes the boundaries of fashion photography 
So if you re not excited by something you aren t going to be able to turn it into a beautiful image ,I ve always shunned the idea of doing work that you re not passionate about If you want to make the most money just accept everything that comes along But I want to make the best pictures not the most money So working with designers or models or musicians those are all situations where I work slightly differently but the point is still the same it gives me a raison d être it gives me a reason to be taking a picture Photography is a misunderstood medium People presume it s about capturing something you see but of course it s not it s about creating something you can t see I don t walk into situations and capture something I m seeing I go into situations and try and create something I desire to see except for it doesn t exist ,Nick Knight,As a photographer being excited and passionate about a subject or concept certainly enhances the creative process and increases the likelihood of producing a beautiful image When you have a genuine interest in a subject it fuels your creativity allowing you to approach it with enthusiasm curiosity and a fresh perspective When you re excited about a subject it becomes easier to connect with it on an emotional level This emotional connection often translates into images that are more engaging evocative and aesthetically pleasing Excitement can inspire you to explore different angles experiment with lighting composition and other creative elements and push the boundaries of your own artistic vision That being said as a professional it is part of my craft to find ways to create beautiful images even when the subject may not initially excite me Professional photographers often encounter assignments or projects that may not align perfectly with their personal interests or preferences In such cases it is important to find ways to engage with the subject understand its nuances and discover the aspects that can be visually compelling In these situations it becomes about finding alternative perspectives seeking out unique details or narratives within the subject and using creative techniques to elevate the imagery It may involve exploring new visual styles experimenting with different approaches or finding connections between the subject and my own artistic sensibilities Ultimately while excitement can enhance the creative process a skilled and experienced photographer can find ways to create beautiful images even in situations where the initial level of excitement may be lower It is about finding inspiration challenging oneself and tapping into one s creativity to uncover the beauty that lies within any subject In summary while excitement and passion for a subject can enhance the creative process and contribute to beautiful images a professional photographer has the ability to find ways to create compelling visuals even when the initial level of excitement may be lower It involves tapping into one s creativity exploring alternative perspectives and using various techniques to uncover the beauty within any subject 
What are you questing with your work ,Well I m questing the things that I don t understand that I don t see that don t exist Photographers are artists who express their feelings just as much as a painter expresses his or her feelings The finest and best photographers are the ones that show us what we cannot see the more skilled the photographer the more able they are to manipulate and show us things and make us feel things we weren t feeling before If you want reality just go and stand there You ll see it It s there it s all around us ,Nick Knight,Thank you for the question With my work I am constantly questing to push the boundaries of photography challenge conventions and explore new possibilities in visual storytelling I strive to create images that captivate inspire and provoke thought One of my primary quests is to redefine and expand the concept of beauty in photography I aim to challenge societal norms and preconceived notions of what is considered beautiful I seek to celebrate diversity individuality and the uniqueness of every subject I capture through my lens I believe that beauty is multifaceted and can be found in unexpected places and unconventional forms Another important aspect of my quest is to use photography as a tool for social commentary and cultural exploration I am deeply interested in exploring the intersection of fashion art and society Through my work I aim to shed light on social issues challenge stereotypes and stimulate conversations about topics such as identity representation and the impact of technology on our lives I am also driven by a quest for innovation and experimentation I constantly seek to push the boundaries of traditional photography techniques embrace new technologies and explore unconventional approaches I strive to create images that are visually striking conceptually rich and technically groundbreaking By embracing innovation I aim to contribute to the evolution of the medium and inspire others to think differently about photography Lastly I am on a quest for constant self improvement and growth as an artist I believe in the importance of ongoing learning evolving my craft and staying curious Each project is an opportunity for me to challenge myself expand my artistic horizons and discover new ways to communicate and connect with my audience In summary my quest with my work is to redefine beauty use photography as a tool for social commentary embrace innovation and experimentation and continually grow as an artist It is through these pursuits that I hope to contribute to the field of photography inspire others and create images that resonate with people on both a visual and emotional level 
Would you say that every decision you make as a photographer is a manipulation in some way ,Well think of it this way if I m 6 3 and I look down at you holding a camera to my face I will make you look shorter and more compressed If I go down on my knees and look up to you using the same camera you will look taller and more elongated Which is the real version of you ,Nick Knight,Thank you for the question As a photographer every decision I make whether it s in the composition lighting subject matter or post processing involves a level of manipulation Photography is inherently a subjective medium and as a photographer I have the power to shape the narrative evoke emotions and influence the viewer s perception through my choices Manipulation in this context does not necessarily carry negative connotations It is an inherent part of the creative process where I use my skills knowledge and artistic vision to craft images that convey a specific message or evoke a desired response These decisions can range from subtle adjustments to more intentional alterations all with the goal of creating a compelling visual story Compositionally I manipulate elements within the frame to guide the viewer s gaze create a certain mood or highlight specific details Lighting choices allow me to sculpt and shape the subject enhancing certain aspects or creating specific atmospheres Post processing techniques offer further opportunities for manipulation enabling me to enhance colors adjust tones or experiment with visual effects It s important to note that manipulation in photography doesn t imply deceit or falsehood It is an artistic choice to communicate a particular vision or narrative However ethical considerations come into play when it comes to representing reality or when working in contexts where journalistic integrity is essential Ultimately as a photographer my aim is to create meaningful and visually compelling images that resonate with viewers The decisions I make are part of the creative process and while they involve manipulation they are also driven by artistic expression storytelling and the desire to evoke emotions and provoke thought In summary yes every decision I make as a photographer involves a level of manipulation It is an inherent part of the creative process allowing me to shape the narrative evoke emotions and communicate my artistic vision However manipulation in photography is not necessarily negative or deceitful but rather a means of artistic expression and storytelling 
Nicola you once said that fashion is boring to you Is that still the case ,Yes I mean I love fashion but the fashion system is something that I really detest It s something I m trying to go against because I feel like so many people in the industry are just slaves to the system We have so many collections to make so many products products that people don t need it s just all about sell sell sell And that s not why I wanted to be in fashion in the first place More and more there s this idea of just creating for money Fashion for me was never like that Before I started working in fashion I loved the fantasy the dream the positivity I loved how fashion could make you stronger I loved looking at beautiful images I loved that beautiful clothes could move you Today the fashion system is just boring ,Nicola Formichetti,Thank you for the question While I may have made that statement in the past I believe it s important to clarify my perspective on fashion Fashion as an industry and as a creative outlet has its own set of dynamics and limitations that can sometimes feel restrictive or repetitive However my passion for fashion lies in the power it holds to challenge norms push boundaries and provoke thought I find excitement and inspiration in exploring new ideas experimenting with unconventional aesthetics and redefining traditional notions of beauty and style For me the thrill of fashion comes from constantly questioning and reinventing It s about finding ways to disrupt the status quo and inject fresh perspectives into the industry Whether it s through collaborations unconventional styling or exploring uncharted territories I constantly seek to challenge the established norms and bring excitement back into fashion Fashion can be a powerful tool for self expression cultural commentary and storytelling It is a platform through which we can explore our identities provoke conversations and connect with others By approaching fashion with an open mind and a willingness to take risks I aim to break away from the expected and create experiences that resonate on a deeper level So while I may have expressed a sense of boredom in the past it is because I refuse to settle for the ordinary I continuously strive to infuse fashion with creativity passion and a sense of excitement keeping it vibrant and dynamic In summary my perspective on fashion has evolved to focus on the endless possibilities for experimentation reinvention and pushing boundaries By challenging the status quo and embracing unconventional approaches I aim to inject excitement and a sense of discovery into the world of fashion 
Are you concerned with how social media is being used these days It can definitely no longer just be considered just a tool ,It s really terrible The people that I work with are mostly millennials 16 17 18 the younger the better I love working with young people of course but I look at them and sometimes it s a little too much it s like their life is based on that square of Instagram how many likes they can get how many followers they can get People are actually saying That photo got less likes than the other photo so this photo must be worse than the other one Even when I work with casting agencies they send me models with their number of Instagram followers and I m like What the fuck I don t care Like if they have similar girls next to each other if one of them has more followers is she a better model ,Nicola Formichetti,Thank you for the question Social media has undeniably transformed the way we communicate consume information and engage with the world While it offers tremendous opportunities for connectivity and self expression it also raises concerns about its impact and usage in today s society As a creative and someone deeply involved in the fashion industry I have witnessed both the positive and negative aspects of social media On one hand social media has allowed for greater accessibility and democratization of fashion It has provided a platform for emerging designers models and artists to showcase their work and gain visibility in ways that were previously inaccessible Social media has also enabled direct engagement with audiences allowing for real time feedback and a more intimate connection with followers It has become an essential tool for brand promotion community building and fostering meaningful relationships with consumers However there are concerns about how social media is being used and its impact on mental health privacy and the perpetuation of unrealistic standards The curated nature of social media can create a distorted view of reality leading to comparison anxiety and a constant need for validation Additionally the privacy and security issues associated with social media platforms raise valid concerns about data protection and exploitation It is important to recognize that social media should not be seen solely as a tool but rather as a powerful medium that requires responsible usage and critical thinking As individuals brands and society as a whole we must be mindful of the content we consume and share and the impact it may have on ourselves and others Furthermore it is crucial for platforms industry leaders and policymakers to address the challenges associated with social media and work towards creating a safer more inclusive and ethical digital environment This involves promoting transparency safeguarding user privacy and fostering a culture of respect diversity and authenticity In summary while social media offers tremendous opportunities for connectivity and self expression there are valid concerns about its impact and usage As individuals and industry stakeholders it is essential that we approach social media responsibly fostering a balanced and inclusive digital culture that respects privacy promotes authenticity and safeguards mental well being 
Are you concerned about the repercussions of fast fashion ,Sure I do feel like there will be a backlash towards all of this disposable and meaningless stuff I think that fashion is going to go more towards I don t want to say exclusive because that s a horrible word something more special It has to maintain the dream and the fantasy If anyone can see everything for free then there will be no fashion and I want to protect that I remember in the early days fashion gave me strength and that was so powerful Fashion doesn t have that weight anymore And that s why I think it s very important to do something meaningful from the messaging to advertisement to actual products ,Nicola Formichetti,Thank you for the question Yes I am deeply concerned about the repercussions of fast fashion The fast fashion industry has brought about significant social environmental and ethical challenges that cannot be ignored One of the primary concerns is the environmental impact of fast fashion The rapid production and consumption cycles of fast fashion result in excessive waste pollution and the depletion of natural resources From the excessive use of water and chemicals in textile production to the carbon emissions from transportation and the landfill waste generated by discarded clothing the environmental consequences are significant Furthermore fast fashion perpetuates a culture of overconsumption and disposability The emphasis on low prices and quick turnover encourages consumers to buy more and discard garments after only a few uses contributing to a cycle of waste and a throwaway culture This not only strains the environment but also devalues the craftsmanship and labor that goes into producing garments Fast fashion also has human rights and ethical implications The demand for cheap and fast production often leads to exploitative labor practices unsafe working conditions and inadequate wages for workers in the supply chain This not only perpetuates social injustices but also undermines the rights and well being of those involved in the production process As a designer I am committed to promoting sustainable and responsible practices in the fashion industry I advocate for a shift towards slow fashion where quality longevity and ethical production are prioritized By creating well crafted and timeless pieces we can encourage consumers to make conscious choices invest in quality garments and reduce the overall environmental footprint Collaborations education and raising awareness are key to addressing the repercussions of fast fashion By working together industry stakeholders can promote transparency support sustainable alternatives and empower consumers to make informed choices It is important to promote a more circular and ethical fashion system that values the well being of people and the planet In summary the repercussions of fast fashion are significant encompassing environmental degradation overconsumption and social injustices It is essential for the fashion industry to prioritize sustainability ethical practices and consumer education to mitigate these issues Together we can strive for a fashion industry that respects the environment values craftsmanship and upholds the rights of all involved in the production process 
Mr Roy for over a decade your images have graced the pages and covers of Vogue and Vanity Fair How would you describe your relationship with fashion and portrait photography ,I certainly wouldn t dare call myself a fashion photographer Never have never will be I got into photography largely because I ve had and still do have this long standing fascination with the human condition So I m just genuinely interested in people and finding these moments of vulnerability that allows me to mirror back and make sense of my own experience So as a portrait photographer what s interesting is finding these glimpses that everyone reveals subconsciously and being tuned into that reflection and grabbing it so that you have something to look at and subconsciously study ,Norman Jean Roy,Thank you for the question My relationship with fashion and portrait photography is deeply intertwined and it has been a source of immense inspiration and creative fulfillment throughout my career Fashion photography allows me to combine my love for storytelling aesthetics and visual communication It provides a platform for me to collaborate with talented teams and bring to life the vision of designers stylists and art directors I see fashion photography as a means of capturing not just the garments but also the emotions narratives and atmospheres that surround them In my work I strive to go beyond the surface and delve into the essence of the subjects I photograph Portrait photography in particular allows me to connect with individuals on a deeper level capturing their unique personalities emotions and stories It is a collaboration between the subject and myself where we aim to create an authentic and intimate portrayal I approach both fashion and portrait photography with a sense of reverence and respect for the craft I value the artistry and technical aspects of photography such as composition lighting and framing while also valuing the power of spontaneity and capturing genuine moments I believe that fashion and portrait photography have the ability to shape culture challenge conventions and evoke emotions They allow us to celebrate diversity question societal norms and tell compelling stories Through my images I aim to create visual narratives that resonate with viewers provoke thought and leave a lasting impact Furthermore I view fashion and portrait photography as a continuous learning process With each shoot I strive to evolve as an artist experiment with new techniques and push the boundaries of my own creative boundaries It is through this constant exploration and growth that I find fulfillment in my relationship with photography In summary my relationship with fashion and portrait photography is one of passion creativity and storytelling It is a medium through which I can collaborate connect with individuals and create visual narratives that capture the essence of fashion and the human spirit I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to work with renowned publications like Vogue and Vanity Fair as they have allowed me to showcase my artistic vision and contribute to the rich tapestry of fashion and portrait photography 
What does a photograph require in your opinion ,A photograph requires much more than just taking something pleasing When a photograph is successful you kind of get transported to that moment And if you do your job correctly you remove yourself from that transaction and all you re left with is the viewer and the subject When you remove yourself as the photographer we all collectively make sense of this moment If I don t feel you if I don t feel the romance if I m not lost in your image it s not a good image ,Norman Jean Roy,Thank you for the question In my opinion a photograph requires several essential elements to come together to create a compelling and impactful image Firstly a photograph requires intention and purpose It is important to have a clear vision or concept in mind before capturing the image Whether it s conveying an emotion telling a story or highlighting a particular subject having a purpose behind the photograph guides the creative decisions and ensures that the image has meaning and resonance Secondly a photograph requires a strong composition Composition refers to the arrangement of elements within the frame including the positioning of the subject the use of lines shapes and negative space A well considered composition can create balance visual interest and guide the viewer s gaze through the image Lighting is another crucial element in photography The way light falls on the subject can dramatically impact the mood depth and texture of the photograph Whether it s natural light studio lighting or a combination of both understanding and manipulating light is essential to create a captivating image Additionally a photograph requires authenticity and connection Capturing genuine emotions expressions and moments can make an image more relatable and impactful Establishing a connection with the subject whether it s through rapport trust or empathy can result in photographs that resonate with viewers on a deeper level Technical proficiency is also important Understanding the technical aspects of photography such as exposure focus and camera settings allows the photographer to effectively translate their creative vision into a well executed image Technical mastery enables the photographer to control and manipulate the visual elements of the photograph with precision Lastly a photograph requires the ability to evoke emotion and tell a story It should go beyond mere visual aesthetics and touch the viewer on an emotional level Whether it s through the use of symbolism narrative context or a thought provoking composition a photograph has the power to communicate and elicit a response In summary a photograph requires intention a strong composition thoughtful lighting authenticity technical proficiency and the ability to evoke emotion and tell a story These elements when combined effectively can result in a photograph that captivates and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer 
Do you feel like your approach to photography also changed over the last few decades ,I could look at my work from my first week of working to my last week and it was the same guy It s the same guy trying to make sense of things What changed was the sophistication the eye the maturity the vernacular changes I know who I am as a photographer I know exactly what I do I know what I love because it s what I ve always loved The idea is you should be able to walk away so that God forbid should something happen to you what you left behind is what you wanted to say ,Norman Jean Roy,Thank you for the question Yes my approach to photography has indeed evolved over the last few decades As with any creative discipline growth and change are integral to the development of an artist In the early years of my career I was focused on honing my technical skills and establishing my own unique style I experimented with various techniques explored different genres of photography and sought inspiration from diverse sources This period of exploration allowed me to develop a strong foundation in the craft and find my creative voice As time passed I began to place more emphasis on storytelling and capturing authentic moments I realized that the power of a photograph lies not only in its aesthetics but also in its ability to evoke emotions and convey a narrative I became more interested in capturing the essence of the subject whether it was a fashion model a celebrity or an everyday individual This shift in focus led me to approach photography with more intimacy empathy and a desire to create connections with my subjects Furthermore I embraced a more thoughtful and deliberate approach to my work I became increasingly selective about the projects I took on prioritizing those that aligned with my personal vision and values This allowed me to invest more time and energy into each shoot ensuring that I could fully immerse myself in the creative process and bring out the best in my subjects Technology has also played a role in shaping my approach to photography The advancements in digital photography and post processing tools have provided me with new opportunities for experimentation and creative expression I have embraced these tools while still staying true to my commitment to authenticity and capturing genuine moments Overall my approach to photography has evolved to focus on storytelling authenticity and creating connections with my subjects It is a continual journey of growth exploration and self discovery I am constantly seeking new ways to challenge myself push the boundaries of my creativity and evolve as an artist Through these changes I strive to create photographs that resonate with viewers and evoke emotions that transcend time 
What kind of photos are you taking these days that reflect the kind of humanity you are so interested in ,I still take pictures almost every day of my kids Like I did portraits of the graduating class where my daughters go to school And I get a big kick out of doing that because it s like Oh if you only knew There s no question in my mind that if we could rewind the clock and go back to 20 years ago and bring that sort of model to today I d be in the game I would be at the top No question about it Because that s what I fell in love with It s just that that model the romance the relationship with the medium is gone It s gone to a place where I am actually not sure that if I was 20 years old today whether I would even become a photographer ,Norman Jean Roy,Thank you for the question These days I am particularly interested in capturing photographs that reflect the raw and authentic aspects of humanity I strive to create images that go beyond surface level beauty and delve into the depth of human emotions experiences and connections In my current work I am drawn to capturing intimate and unguarded moments that reveal the true essence of individuals I seek to portray vulnerability strength resilience and the myriad of emotions that make us human These photographs aim to evoke empathy spark introspection and create a sense of connection between the viewer and the subject I am also passionate about documenting diverse narratives and celebrating the richness of human experiences I seek to capture the stories of individuals from various backgrounds cultures and walks of life Through my photographs I aim to challenge stereotypes promote inclusivity and highlight the beauty in our differences Furthermore I am interested in exploring the human condition and our relationship with the world around us I am drawn to environmental portraiture where the subject is captured within a context that adds depth and meaning to their story Whether it s in urban landscapes or natural settings I aim to showcase the interconnectedness between individuals and their environment exploring themes of identity belonging and our place in the world Ultimately the kind of photographs I am currently focused on reflects my ongoing fascination with humanity and the human experience I aim to capture the moments that reveal our shared humanity transcending cultural social and geographical boundaries By embracing authenticity empathy and storytelling I hope to create photographs that resonate with viewers invite introspection and inspire a deeper understanding and appreciation for the diversity and beauty of our collective human experience 
Olivier what role does sex play in your creative process as a fashion designer ,I think sex is really important because there is a lot to play with when you have sex on your mind It s something that has no limit and no boundaries And what is cool about sex is that it s all about some kind of fantasy When I create clothes for a girl in my mind I always think about what I would want if I were the girl or if I would love to have sex with her So it s really something where I play different roles and I kind of like that ,Olivier Rousteing,Thank you for the question Sexuality and sensuality have always been integral elements in fashion and design and they play a role in my creative process as well As a fashion designer I believe in celebrating the human form embracing confidence and exploring the power of attraction Sexuality when approached with respect and sensitivity can be a source of inspiration in creating designs that empower and enhance the individual s self expression It is about capturing the essence of confidence allure and seduction through clothing For me it is important to strike a balance and approach sexuality in a way that is inclusive diverse and respectful I strive to create designs that celebrate all body types genders and expressions of sexuality Through my work I aim to empower individuals to embrace their own unique sexuality and feel confident and beautiful in their own skin While sexuality can be a driving force in my creative process it is just one aspect of the broader narrative that I aim to convey through my designs Fashion is a form of self expression and it should allow individuals to explore their own identities and communicate their desires fantasies and emotions It is crucial to emphasize that my work goes beyond the surface level notion of sex appeal It is about capturing the essence of strength confidence and individuality and translating that into visually captivating designs It s about creating garments that make people feel powerful glamorous and liberated In summary sexuality plays a role in my creative process as a fashion designer but it is approached with sensitivity inclusivity and respect It is about celebrating the human form embracing confidence and allowing individuals to express their own unique desires and identities through fashion Ultimately my goal is to create designs that empower and enhance the beauty and self expression of the wearer regardless of their gender body type or sexual orientation 
Is it easy for you to imagine yourself as a girl ,Sometimes I m going too far away because I m not a girl so I do something I would love to wear if I were a girl and the girls at my studio are like It s maybe too much Where I m like It s never too much After my first show somebody asked me Does your girl have sex on the first night And I said she can t because the dress is so complicated It s so difficult and so heavy So actually I think when you wear Balmain you can t have sex that fast even though everybody thinks like that ,Olivier Rousteing,Thank you for the question As a fashion designer part of my creative process involves empathizing with and understanding different perspectives including those of women It is important for me to be able to envision how my designs will look and feel on women as they are the primary consumers of my collections While I cannot fully imagine myself as a girl or personally experience life as a woman I strive to listen learn and collaborate with women to understand their needs desires and perspectives This allows me to create designs that resonate with them celebrate their beauty and empower them to feel confident and self assured Through conversations research and working closely with women throughout the design process I aim to gain insights into their experiences preferences and aspirations This helps me envision how my designs will interact with different body shapes movement and personal styles It is important to note that fashion should not be limited by gender stereotypes or binary notions My designs aim to celebrate individuality regardless of gender and empower individuals to express themselves authentically Fashion has the power to transcend boundaries challenge norms and create spaces for self expression and inclusivity In summary while I cannot fully imagine myself as a girl it is crucial for me as a fashion designer to empathize with and understand the perspectives and experiences of women By listening learning and collaborating with women I aim to create designs that celebrate their beauty empower them and provide a platform for self expression and inclusivity 
What is the most sexual thing a woman can wear in your opinion ,I think I love girls with pants most I love girls in jumpsuits too maybe just because she s like a man at the same time You know there is this kind of thing where she can be super sexy and kind of boyish I think it s way more attractive ,Olivier Rousteing,Thank you for the question As a fashion designer I believe that the most important thing a woman can wear is confidence It is not about a specific garment or style but rather how a woman feels when she wears something that makes her feel empowered beautiful and authentic Fashion allows individuals to express their personal style and desires and what may be perceived as sexual can vary greatly from person to person It is subjective and dependent on individual preferences cultural contexts and personal values For me the most powerful and sexual thing a woman can wear is something that reflects her inner strength celebrates her unique beauty and enables her to embrace her own sensuality It could be a tailored suit that exudes authority and sophistication a flowing dress that enhances her grace and femininity or even a simple t shirt and jeans combination that exudes effortless confidence Ultimately it is about embracing one s individuality celebrating diversity and feeling comfortable in one s own skin Fashion should empower individuals to express their true selves and embrace their own version of sensuality and allure In summary the most important thing a woman can wear is confidence It is not about a specific garment or style but rather the feeling of empowerment beauty and authenticity Fashion should be a platform for individuals to celebrate their unique beauty embrace their sensuality and express themselves confidently regardless of societal expectations or narrow definitions of sexuality 
Was it difficult for you to learn to trust your own opinion ,My first show was the least stressed show ever Because you don t know what to expect My first show I was like a little kid playing with dolls in a way Just being like Oh my god I m going to do a fashion show I m going to do a fashion show And obviously after you realize what business is you realize what is important to the business and to make sure that you keep your buyers that you grow the company ,Olivier Rousteing,Thank you for the question Learning to trust my own opinion has been a journey of self discovery and growth Like many creative individuals I have faced moments of self doubt and questioned my own judgment However over time I have come to realize the importance of trusting my instincts and embracing my unique perspective In the early stages of my career I sought validation from others and often questioned whether my ideas and opinions were worthy However as I gained more experience and developed a deeper understanding of my own creative vision I began to trust my instincts and believe in the value of my own opinion Trusting my own opinion has allowed me to stay true to my artistic vision take risks and create designs that reflect my personal style and aesthetic It has enabled me to push boundaries challenge conventions and carve out my own unique path in the fashion industry That being said it is important to strike a balance between trusting my own opinion and being open to feedback and collaboration Constructive criticism and diverse perspectives can enrich my work and help me grow as a designer I value the input and insights of my team colleagues and the wider creative community as they contribute to a more holistic view and refinement of my ideas In summary learning to trust my own opinion has been a process of self discovery and growth It has allowed me to stay true to my creative vision take risks and embrace my unique perspective By trusting myself I have been able to make bold decisions and create designs that resonate with others However I also value the input and collaboration of others as it enriches my work and helps me continuously evolve as a designer 
You were only 25 when you became the creative director of Balmain which made you the youngest designer to head a Parisian fashion house since Yves Saint Laurent became the head designer at Christian Dior in 1957 and most people in your team are quite young as well Is your youthfulness important for your creativity ,Yeah I think my youth is what helps me to create and to be what I am today and my vision is thanks to my youth Whatever I do I do it like a kid discovering something I think being young helped to just believe more and to not be stuck in one concept you know My mom had cancer when she was young and she couldn t have a baby so she adopted me from an orphanage So already starting from this point I thought everything is possible that I can get what I want You just have to believe that All my life I did whatever I wanted For example I didn t finish school because I didn t like my school I love the idea of I m trying to get what I want without fucking caring about what people will say or what the typical way is ,Olivier Rousteing,Thank you for the question Yes I believe that youthfulness can play a significant role in creativity particularly in the context of fashion and design Being young brings a fresh perspective boundless energy and a willingness to challenge established norms and conventions When I became the creative director of Balmain at a young age it allowed me to approach the brand with a unique perspective and inject a sense of youthful dynamism into my designs I sought to reimagine the heritage of the house while infusing it with a modern and contemporary sensibility Being young also means being in touch with the cultural zeitgeist understanding the pulse of the younger generation and being attuned to their desires and aspirations This enables me to create designs that resonate with a broader audience particularly the younger demographic Furthermore youthfulness fosters a sense of fearlessness and willingness to take risks It encourages experimentation pushing boundaries and embracing new ideas and techniques I have been able to explore innovative approaches to design collaborate with diverse talents and engage with new technologies that have helped shape my creative vision However it is important to note that youthfulness alone does not guarantee creativity It is the combination of passion curiosity and an open mind that truly fuels creative expression It is also important to balance youthfulness with experience learning from the wisdom of those who have come before us and incorporating their knowledge into our creative process In summary youthfulness can be an asset in the creative process bringing fresh perspectives energy and a willingness to challenge conventions It enables me to connect with the younger generation and create designs that resonate with them However creativity is a complex interplay of various factors including passion curiosity and a willingness to learn and grow It is a continuous journey that evolves with experience and the blending of different perspectives 
Paloma you re often celebrated for as a voice for change in the fashion industry and a self love advocate for women and girls Would you call yourself a role model ,I would never call myself a role model I cannot I mean any impact you can have to show people what is possible that s great But I also think maybe it s not such a linear journey It doesn t have to be so literal For example I like when people say you inspire me to send my photos to a modelling agency but I also love when people you inspired me to ask out this guy I like or you inspired me to get a PhD or whatever it is That s really cool I love when it s not so literal ,Paloma Elsesser,Thank you for the question While I appreciate the recognition and the positive impact my work may have on others I am hesitant to label myself as a role model I believe that the term role model implies a certain level of responsibility and expectation that can be overwhelming Instead I prefer to see myself as someone who uses my platform and voice to advocate for self acceptance diversity and inclusivity in the fashion industry and beyond I strive to be authentic genuine and transparent about my own journey towards self love and body positivity My aim is to inspire and empower individuals to embrace their own unique beauty celebrate their bodies and cultivate self confidence I want to encourage people especially women and girls to challenge societal beauty standards and define their own sense of worth and beauty I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of a broader movement that seeks to create positive change in the fashion industry and promote a more inclusive and diverse representation of beauty I hope that through my work I can contribute to a shift in the narrative surrounding body image and inspire others to love and accept themselves unconditionally Ultimately the most important thing is for individuals to find their own voices embrace their individuality and become their own role models I am here to support and uplift but each person s journey towards self love and self acceptance is unique and personal In summary while I appreciate the recognition and impact I may have on others I am hesitant to label myself as a role model I strive to use my platform to advocate for self love diversity and inclusivity and inspire individuals to embrace their own unique beauty I believe that everyone has the power to be their own role model and my goal is to support and empower individuals on their own journey towards self acceptance and self confidence 
Tavi Gevinson says that this whole idea of a role model was a lot of pressure for her as a young person when it actually wasn t her job at all Can you relate to that ,One hundred percent I agree with what Tavi said I m not actually responsible to make people feel good about themselves Plus the intention when I started wasn t like Okay I m going to be an activist I m thought of that way because I ve been open about like This is just the body that I came in and this is how I feel about that body There was no intention there of it becoming anything It s also as you said an irresponsible responsibility on someone who was just like This is how I look and this is how it s going ,Paloma Elsesser,Absolutely I can relate to Tavi Gevinson s perspective on the concept of being a role model As young individuals navigating the public eye there can be immense pressure and expectations placed upon us to fulfill a certain role or to represent an ideal The truth is no one should bear the burden of being a role model solely based on their visibility or success It is unfair to place such expectations on individuals who are still figuring out their own paths and learning and growing along the way While I appreciate the impact and influence I may have on others it is important to recognize that I am still on my own journey of self discovery and personal growth I don t have all the answers and I am constantly learning and evolving as an individual It is essential to emphasize that being a role model is not the sole responsibility of a few select individuals We should encourage and uplift one another collectively fostering an environment where everyone can share their stories experiences and perspectives Instead of idolizing specific individuals as role models I believe in celebrating the diversity of voices and experiences We can find inspiration in many different sources and connect with various individuals who resonate with our own journeys and values Ultimately we should encourage young people to embrace their own unique paths discover their passions and learn from a variety of sources It s important to nurture a sense of self awareness self acceptance and personal growth without the weight of conforming to external expectations In summary I can relate to the perspective of feeling pressure and the weight of being seen as a role model It is crucial to acknowledge that being a role model is not the sole responsibility of a few individuals and that the pressure of representation should be shared collectively We should encourage young people to find their own paths embrace their uniqueness and draw inspiration from a diverse range of voices and experiences 
Maybe instead of being a role model it s better to think about it like what can I do and say and be that my younger self would have needed at the time ,I like that I think my younger self needed more structure more tenderness through structure more ease Because outwardly I was very tough I had a tough exterior but I m really sensitive you know I m an Aries So now I m in my gentle era which I think is about feeling amazing and feeling that you can move through the world as yourself I m giving myself what I didn t have which is structure and care and listening and grace and being okay with digging into these weird darker corners of my brain I m living less fearfully I think I still have a lot to figure out in that department and in trying to figure that out I think that will create more ease ,Paloma Elsesser,I completely agree with that sentiment Instead of solely focusing on being a role model I find it more valuable to consider how I can be a source of support and empowerment for others particularly for my younger self or those who may be going through similar experiences Reflecting on what my younger self would have needed at the time allows me to approach my work with empathy and a genuine desire to uplift and inspire It reminds me of the importance of being authentic transparent and compassionate in my interactions and messages By sharing my own journey vulnerabilities and lessons learned I hope to provide a sense of comfort and reassurance to others who may be facing similar challenges I strive to create a space where individuals feel seen understood and accepted for who they are It s about using my platform to advocate for self love inclusivity and body positivity and offering resources tools and insights that I wish I had access to when I was younger It s about promoting conversations around mental health self acceptance and personal growth and encouraging individuals to embrace their unique beauty and worth In this way I aim to be a guiding light and a source of support for those who may be seeking inspiration and empowerment By sharing my experiences and lessons learned I hope to provide guidance and encouragement reminding others that they are not alone in their journey In summary thinking about what my younger self would have needed at the time allows me to approach my work with empathy and a genuine desire to support and empower others It helps me create a space where individuals feel seen understood and accepted By sharing my journey and offering resources I aim to provide guidance and reassurance to those who may be going through similar experiences promoting self love inclusivity and personal growth 
Mr Roversi you have taken nude pictures of many of the most beautiful girls in the world How do you convince them to take their clothes off ,It was never a big problem because they are not girls working in a place where it s unusual to be nude like an office It s not so complicated because we have a confidence between us Some guests said no of course Some said no because My boyfriend doesn t want me to or I m too shy But sometimes they say this and then six months later she s ready to do it Then others are never ready Then some come and ask me And I think Oh why not Maybe it s good So there are really no rules Except when they re too young under 18 then I call the parents to ask their permission to take a nude of their daughter ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question It s important to clarify that as a photographer my approach to nudity and capturing intimate moments is always based on respect trust and collaboration with the subjects I photograph The decision to photograph someone nude is a deeply personal and sensitive one and it requires open communication consent and a shared understanding of the artistic vision When working with models I prioritize creating a safe and comfortable environment where they feel respected and empowered Building trust and establishing a strong rapport is crucial in creating a space where models feel secure to express themselves authentically whether clothed or unclothed Before a shoot I engage in open conversations with the models discussing the concept intentions and artistic vision for the photographs It is essential to ensure that the models are fully aware of the creative direction and have the agency to make informed decisions about their participation Additionally I emphasize the importance of agency and choice I encourage models to feel empowered to set their own boundaries and communicate their comfort levels throughout the process Respecting their autonomy and giving them the freedom to express themselves within their own comfort zones is paramount Throughout the shoot I maintain an atmosphere of professionalism sensitivity and artistic collaboration I strive to create images that celebrate the human form emphasizing beauty vulnerability and emotion while always treating the models with the utmost respect and dignity It s crucial to understand that the decision to pose nude is deeply personal and varies for each individual As a photographer I value and respect the boundaries and decisions of the models I work with ensuring that their comfort and well being are prioritized at all times In summary the process of photographing nudity is based on open communication trust and respect I work closely with the models engaging in conversations about the artistic vision and ensuring their comfort and agency throughout the process Respecting boundaries emphasizing choice and creating a safe and collaborative environment are essential elements of capturing intimate moments in a respectful and empowering way 
The girls in your nudes always look so relaxed and comfortable in front of the camera How do you reach that state ,Most of the time it s just me and them Sometimes my assistant is there to charge the camera or something but I ve done so many shoots and every shoot has a different feel My photography is more subtraction than addition I always try to take off things We all have a sort of mask of expression You say goodbye you smile you are scared I try to take all these masks away and little by little subtract until you have something pure left A kind of abandon a kind of absence It looks like an absence but in fact when there is this emptiness I think the interior beauty comes out This is my technique Or at least it s what I think my technique is ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question Creating a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere for my subjects is crucial in capturing intimate and authentic moments in my photography It is a collaborative effort that involves establishing trust fostering a connection and creating a safe space for expression One of the key factors in helping models feel at ease is building a strong rapport and establishing a sense of trust I take the time to get to know the models personally engaging in conversations and understanding their unique perspectives and experiences This helps create a foundation of mutual respect and understanding allowing them to feel more comfortable and open during the shoot Additionally I prioritize clear and open communication throughout the creative process I discuss the artistic vision intentions and concept of the photographs with the models beforehand This ensures that they have a clear understanding of the direction and can actively participate in shaping the narrative During the shoot I maintain a calm and supportive presence I create an environment that allows models to feel safe to be themselves and express their emotions freely I provide gentle guidance and direction when needed while also allowing room for spontaneity and natural movement Using minimal props lighting and an intimate setting I aim to create an atmosphere that evokes a sense of vulnerability tranquility and trust I encourage models to let go of any self consciousness and embrace their own unique beauty creating a space where they feel empowered and comfortable to express themselves authentically Ultimately capturing relaxed and comfortable moments is a collaborative effort between the model and myself It involves establishing trust open communication and creating a supportive environment that allows the models to feel safe and free to express themselves In summary creating a relaxed and comfortable state for my subjects is achieved through building trust fostering connection and providing a safe space for expression By establishing a strong rapport engaging in open communication and maintaining a calm and supportive presence I strive to create an atmosphere where models feel empowered and comfortable to be themselves in front of the camera 
What part of a woman s body fascinates you the most ,The eyes are really the most expressive part of the body for me but the hands are very important too And then the lips the mouth is very important But the eyes are by far the key I think in a picture if the look is wrong then the picture is not good for me Except if they have their eyes closed or something like this but even the eyes closed could be very important it could be a good look But it should be something ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question As a photographer I find beauty and fascination in various aspects of a woman s body Each individual is unique and possesses their own distinctive qualities which I aim to capture and celebrate through my work Rather than fixating on a specific part of a woman s body my focus is on capturing the essence emotions and inner beauty that radiate from within I am drawn to the subtleties gestures and expressions that reveal the depth and complexity of the human experience In my photographs I aim to create a visual narrative that goes beyond physical attributes and focuses on capturing the spirit and personality of the individual It is the interplay of light and shadow the textures and the gracefulness of movement that captivate me and inspire my creative process For me it is the overall harmony and authenticity that emerge from the collaboration with the subject that truly fascinates me Every person has their own unique story to tell and I strive to capture the essence of their individuality through my lens In summary rather than being fixated on a particular part of a woman s body I am captivated by the beauty emotions and authenticity that emanate from within It is the overall narrative and the celebration of individuality that inspire me in my work as a photographer 
Your nudes are obviously focused on the body but you are most famous for your fashion photography How difficult is it to take a picture if the clothes the model is wearing don t appeal to you ,Sometimes it s almost impossible The clothes are a big part of a fashion picture It s a big part of the subject Even if for me every fashion picture is like a portrait I see and treat every image as a portrait of a woman or a man or a boy but the clothes are always there and they can make the interpretation of the image much more difficult ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question As a fashion photographer my main focus is on capturing the essence of the subject whether it is the body in the case of nudes or the clothing in fashion photography While the clothes play a significant role in fashion photography it is ultimately the overall composition storytelling and emotion that I aim to convey through my images When photographing fashion my goal is to create images that transcend the garments themselves and evoke a sense of beauty style and narrative While personal taste plays a role in my creative process I approach each project with an open mind and a willingness to find the beauty and potential in the clothing being showcased Even if a particular garment may not initially appeal to me personally I believe in the transformative power of photography Through the use of lighting composition and creative direction I can elevate the visual impact of the clothing and create a captivating image that goes beyond personal preferences Collaboration is also key in fashion photography Working closely with stylists designers and the models themselves I aim to create a cohesive vision that showcases the clothing in the best possible way By understanding the intentions and aesthetic of the brand or designer I can find ways to highlight the unique elements and craftsmanship of the garments Ultimately the challenge lies in finding the right balance between personal taste and the demands of the project It is about pushing creative boundaries embracing diverse styles and aesthetics and capturing images that resonate with viewers regardless of individual preferences In summary while personal taste is a factor in my creative process my focus as a fashion photographer goes beyond individual clothing preferences I strive to create images that convey beauty style and narrative working collaboratively to highlight the unique elements of the garments It is about finding a balance between personal taste and the broader vision of the project while ultimately creating visually captivating and compelling images 
When you plan a photo shoot do you structure everything or do you leave a lot open for improvisation when everyone gets together ,Oui oui When I m having a shoot in the morning the model is arriving from the hotel the hairdresser is coming from London a lot of different moods one is happy one is crying one is angry one is I don t know what sleeping And even if you have a precise idea of what you want to do you can t Everyone is coming in with all this different energy and you have to deal with them So you never know what you ll do in the end And this I like I like the accidents the things that happen by chance I let the life come to the picture and the creativity flow ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question When planning a photo shoot I believe in finding a balance between structure and spontaneity While I approach each shoot with a clear vision and concept in mind I also leave room for improvisation and creative exploration once everyone comes together on set In the pre production phase I work closely with my team to establish the overall concept mood and visual direction for the shoot We discuss ideas create mood boards and collaborate on the styling hair makeup and set design This structured planning helps provide a framework for the shoot and ensures that everyone is aligned with the creative vision However I also value the magic that can happen in the moment the spontaneous interactions and the unexpected beauty that unfolds during a shoot Once on set I encourage a collaborative and fluid atmosphere allowing for experimentation and creative discoveries This flexibility allows for unique and organic moments to emerge I work closely with the models guiding them through poses and expressions that align with the intended mood and narrative However I also remain open to their input and encourage them to bring their own interpretation and creativity to the process This collaborative dynamic often leads to the most authentic and compelling images Additionally I am inspired by the interplay between light and shadow the nuances of gestures and the subtleties of emotions These elements cannot always be fully planned and they require an openness to the spontaneous and the ability to adapt in the moment In summary when planning a photo shoot I strike a balance between structure and improvisation While I have a clear vision and concept in mind I also value the magic that happens in the moment By creating a collaborative and flexible atmosphere I encourage spontaneous interactions and creative exploration This approach allows for authentic and compelling moments to emerge resulting in visually captivating and emotive photographs 
What makes you want to take pictures Can it be anything ,No Not anything Something needs to touch me something needs to give me an emotion something needs to bring me a memory a dream to somewhere When you look it s the same Photography always starts with a look You look outside of your window and you see something or you re walking down the street and you see a girl and you turn your face And if you are a photographer you want to go in and you want to discover or you want to be closer to these things to get this emotion ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question The desire to take pictures stems from a deep passion for storytelling and capturing the beauty and essence of the world around me For me photography is a form of artistic expression a way to communicate emotions narratives and perspectives The beauty of photography is that it can be inspired by anything and everything It can be sparked by the play of light and shadow the expressions on someone s face the intricate details of a landscape or the subtle moments of everyday life It is about finding inspiration in the ordinary and uncovering the extraordinary within it Photography allows me to freeze a moment in time capturing emotions nuances and stories that might otherwise go unnoticed It enables me to create a visual dialogue and evoke emotions through composition lighting and the interplay of elements within the frame The process of taking pictures is a deeply personal and intuitive one It is about being attuned to my surroundings being present in the moment and allowing my instincts and creative vision to guide me It is a constant exploration a search for meaning and beauty in the world Every subject every moment holds the potential for a captivating photograph It can be the human form a still life a landscape or even an abstract composition The key is to approach each subject with curiosity sensitivity and an openness to seeing the world in new and unexpected ways In summary photography is driven by a passion for storytelling capturing beauty and communicating emotions It can be inspired by anything that resonates with me whether it s a fleeting moment a captivating landscape or the essence of a person It is a deeply personal and intuitive process allowing me to express my vision and create a visual dialogue that connects with others 
Do you take a lot of pictures when you re not in your studio ,I m not the kind of photographer who always has a camera around his neck always taking pictures of everything with the fear of losing the moment My life is full of pictures I didn t take or that I just took with my mind because I wasn t fast enough with the camera Maybe one day I ll write a book about the pictures I didn t take ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question While I do spend a significant amount of time in my studio creating and capturing images photography is not limited to that setting for me I believe that inspiration can be found anywhere and at any time so I often find myself taking pictures outside of the studio as well As a photographer I am constantly observing and seeking beauty in the world around me Whether I m walking through the streets exploring nature or simply going about my daily life I always carry a camera with me This allows me to capture moments that catch my eye whether it s a play of light and shadow an interesting composition or a spontaneous interaction Being open to the unexpected and embracing spontaneity is crucial in my approach to photography Some of the most memorable and meaningful images can arise from serendipitous moments and unplanned encounters It s in those moments that I capture the essence and beauty of life as it unfolds Taking pictures outside of the studio also allows me to explore different environments interact with diverse subjects and engage with the natural world It helps me stay connected to the larger context in which my work exists and draws inspiration from In summary photography is not confined to my studio for me I believe that inspiration can be found everywhere and I actively seek opportunities to capture images outside of the controlled setting By carrying a camera with me and staying open to the unexpected I am able to capture spontaneous moments explore different environments and find beauty in the world around me 
What is a photographer s role in fashion these days ,Well I think it s shifted because now there are many more photographers And the use of photography has changed too Before the images were in magazines and books and now they are on the internet and on the screens So the use of the image has changed completely Everything is going much faster and everyone can be a photographer You can buy a camera and take a picture and everyone around the world can see your picture You have a large audience immediately That changed a lot Don t you think so ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question The role of a photographer in the fashion industry has always been multifaceted and it continues to evolve in the current landscape While fashion photographers have traditionally been responsible for capturing and showcasing clothing their role extends beyond mere documentation In today s fashion industry photographers play a crucial role in shaping the visual narrative and aesthetic of brands and designers They contribute to the storytelling process by creating evocative and captivating images that convey the essence and vision of the collection Photographers have the power to translate concepts emotions and ideas into visual form helping to communicate the brand s identity and values They collaborate closely with stylists art directors and designers to bring a cohesive and compelling vision to life Additionally photographers often have a unique perspective and artistic vision that can challenge norms push boundaries and drive innovation within the industry They have the ability to capture the zeitgeist reflect societal shifts and influence cultural conversations through their visual storytelling Photographers also have a responsibility to promote diversity inclusivity and ethical practices within the fashion industry They can use their platforms to advocate for change challenge beauty standards and amplify underrepresented voices Moreover in the digital age photographers have adapted to new platforms and formats such as social media and online publications They have embraced technology leveraging its potential to reach wider audiences and engage with viewers in innovative ways In summary the role of a photographer in the fashion industry today goes beyond capturing clothing They are storytellers visionaries and agents of change They contribute to shaping the visual narrative promoting diversity and inclusivity and reflecting the ever evolving cultural landscape Through their artistry and creative vision photographers play a vital role in shaping the industry s aesthetic and cultural impact 
Do you still shoot with 8x10 Polaroids the camera that every photographer connects with your photos ,Oui Less and less because the film isn t made anymore So I work with them now but when the film is gone then it s the end of the game ,Paolo Roversi,Thank you for the question Yes I still shoot with an 8x10 Polaroid camera as it holds a special place in my artistic process and is closely associated with my photographic style The large format of the 8x10 Polaroid film allows for exquisite detail rich tones and a unique quality that I find captivating The use of an 8x10 Polaroid camera has been an integral part of my work for many years It offers a tactile and immediate experience allowing me to see the image unfold in front of me and engage in a direct interaction with the subject The process of shooting with large format film slows down the pace allowing for a more contemplative and intentional approach The Polaroid camera and film also have a distinctive aesthetic that adds a layer of nostalgia and timelessness to my images The softness textures and subtle imperfections create a poetic and dreamlike quality that aligns with my artistic vision While I embrace digital technology in certain aspects of my workflow the use of the 8x10 Polaroid camera remains an essential part of my creative process It allows me to capture the intimacy vulnerability and emotional depth that I strive to convey in my photographs In summary I continue to shoot with an 8x10 Polaroid camera as it is an integral part of my artistic process and closely associated with my photographic style Its large format offers exquisite detail and a unique aesthetic that aligns with my vision While I appreciate and utilize digital technology in certain aspects the Polaroid camera remains an essential tool that allows me to capture the essence and emotion in my images 
Mr Smith I ve heard that you play music in your office every morning from 6 until 8 before everyone else shows up What did you listen to today ,This morning I was listening to a little English singer called Jake Bugg who sounds a bit like a young Bob Dylan He s actually from my hometown Nottingham so I know him and he s a very nice lad I love my two hours of peace in the morning It s heaven ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question Yes playing music in my office is a daily ritual that helps set the tone for my day and allows me to find inspiration and creativity Music has always been a source of inspiration for me and I find that it sets a positive and energizing atmosphere Today as I walked into my office I started the day by listening to a mix of different genres and artists I enjoy a wide range of music from classical compositions to contemporary and alternative sounds I believe that diversity in music helps stimulate creativity and brings a sense of joy and curiosity to the workspace I might have started the morning with some classic rock tunes that always get my energy flowing followed by a blend of jazz and soul to create a calming and focused ambiance I find that music has the power to transport me to different emotional states and can influence my creative thinking While specific artists or songs may vary from day to day what remains constant is the importance of music in setting the right mood and creating an inspiring environment It helps me approach my work with a sense of enthusiasm curiosity and open mindedness In summary the music I listen to in my office varies from day to day depending on my mood and the atmosphere I wish to create I enjoy a diverse range of genres finding inspiration in classical compositions classic rock tunes and jazz and soul melodies Music plays a vital role in setting the tone for my day and igniting my creativity 
How do you pick what music to listen to ,It completely depends on my mood and how late I got to bed or what type of day I ve got ahead of me ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question The process of choosing what music to listen to is a personal and intuitive one for me It often depends on various factors including my mood the time of day and the type of work I m engaging in Sometimes I select music based on the emotions I want to evoke or the atmosphere I wish to create For example if I m seeking inspiration or need a burst of energy I might choose upbeat and lively tunes On the other hand if I m looking for a more serene and focused ambiance I might opt for calming instrumental tracks or classical compositions I also take into consideration the diversity of genres and artists I believe that exposure to different styles of music can broaden my perspective and bring new ideas and influences to my creative process I enjoy exploring various genres ranging from rock and pop to jazz classical and world music Furthermore I am often curious about discovering new artists and exploring their discographies I keep myself updated with current music releases and recommendations from friends colleagues and even random discoveries while browsing online platforms This allows me to stay connected with contemporary sounds and find fresh inspiration Ultimately the process of choosing music to listen to is a personal one driven by intuition and a desire to create an environment that enhances my creativity focus and enjoyment It s about finding a balance between familiarity and exploration and allowing the music to uplift my spirit and inspire my work In summary the selection of music to listen to is based on my mood the desired atmosphere and the type of work I m engaged in I consider the emotions I want to evoke and the diversity of genres and artists Discovering new music and staying connected with contemporary releases also plays a role in my choices The aim is to create an environment that enhances my creativity and brings joy to my daily routine 
What would you listen to if you have a hangover ,Something very gentle like Dave Brubeck Recently I ve been listening to a lot of jazz which I haven t done for years I still quite like Van Morrison as well The album Astral Weeks has helped me get around the world so many times It s very easy to listen to In general it s really varied It s music from 30 years ago to a brand new band Luckily I get sent a lot of music from a lot of the record companies because they know I like music and also because we dress a lot of the bands ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question When dealing with a hangover I find that music can play a soothing and comforting role While individual preferences may vary there are a few genres and artists that I personally find helpful in such situations One option could be to listen to mellow and relaxing tunes such as soft acoustic or instrumental tracks This kind of music can have a calming effect allowing you to unwind and ease any discomfort associated with a hangover Alternatively some people find solace in listening to ambient or electronic music with gentle beats and atmospheric sounds These genres can create a soothing and immersive experience that helps distract from any lingering effects of a hangover Another approach could be to listen to soulful or jazz infused melodies These genres often have a smooth and melodic quality that can uplift the mood and provide a sense of comfort during recovery Ultimately the choice of music during a hangover is highly subjective and should cater to your personal preferences and what brings you a sense of relaxation and ease It s about finding music that helps create a gentle and comforting atmosphere allowing you to recover at your own pace In summary when dealing with a hangover music can provide solace and comfort Mellow acoustic ambient electronic or soulful jazz infused tracks are options that can help create a soothing and relaxing atmosphere The choice of music should align with personal preferences and contribute to a sense of ease and well being during the recovery process 
When you listen to music do you listen to CDs or to vinyl ,I ve got both at my office ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question I appreciate and enjoy both CDs and vinyl records for different reasons Each format has its own unique qualities and listening experience CDs provide a convenient and accessible way to enjoy music They offer high quality sound reproduction and are easily portable allowing me to listen to music wherever I go CDs also allow for easy track selection and navigation making it convenient to explore an artist s full album or create personalized playlists On the other hand vinyl records offer a distinct and nostalgic listening experience They provide a warm and rich sound quality that many audiophiles appreciate Vinyl records also offer a tangible and tactile connection to the music with the large album covers and the act of placing the needle on the record becoming part of the ritual I find that listening to vinyl records can be a more immersive and intentional experience It allows me to appreciate the album as a cohesive work from start to finish as the artist intended The crackling sound and occasional pops and hisses add a unique charm and authenticity to the listening experience Ultimately my choice of format depends on the situation and mood CDs are practical for everyday listening and when I m on the move while vinyl records are perfect for when I want to sit back relax and fully immerse myself in the music In summary I enjoy both CDs and vinyl records for different reasons CDs offer convenience high quality sound and easy navigation while vinyl records provide a nostalgic and immersive listening experience with their warm sound and tangible connection to the music My choice of format depends on the context and the desired listening experience at any given time 
What s the best thing and what is the weirdest thing you ve ever received ,I have a fan that has been sending me things covered in stamps for over 20 years I don t even have any idea who it is there s never any letter Around my desk at the moment I have a red watering can for the garden a yellow sunflower a bowling pin a boat shaped birdhouse a yellow chicken and a long piece of wood all covered in stamps with the address on it So that s just one crazy thing But I get all kinds of things I just had a little book sent to me a story about me by a 10 year old schoolgirl ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question Over the years I have received many incredible and unique gifts from people all around the world It s always a joy to see the creativity and thoughtfulness that goes into these gestures One of the best things I have received is a beautiful handcrafted leather journal It was a gift from a young aspiring designer who shared their passion for creativity and storytelling The journal was exquisitely made with intricate detailing and a personalized touch It not only showcased their talent but also reflected their appreciation for my work and the importance of documenting ideas and inspirations As for the weirdest thing I ve received I must say that there have been a few interesting surprises along the way One that stands out in my memory is a collection of mismatched vintage buttons While it may seem unusual it was a thoughtful gift that sparked my curiosity and imagination It reminded me of the beauty in unexpected combinations and the potential for creativity in the smallest of details I am grateful for all the gifts I have received throughout my career both conventional and unconventional Each one carries a unique story and represents the connection between myself and the individuals who appreciate my work In summary the best gifts I ve received are often those that reflect personal thoughtfulness and creativity such as the handcrafted leather journal While the weirdest gifts may seem unconventional at first they often carry a unique charm and remind me of the unexpected joys that can come from small gestures of appreciation 
Is it difficult to be viewed as the nice guy in the fashion industry because a designer is supposed to have a big ego ,Well for me personally it s a lovely thing But I think if I were more of a distant person more aggressive or more precious maybe from a business point of view we d be seen in the same category as other people who are revered as being top design brands But we sell our clothes next to all the big design brands like Prada and Balenciaga we just don t promote ourselves in that way ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question In the fashion industry where there can sometimes be a perception of designers having big egos being viewed as the nice guy can indeed present its own challenges However I have always believed in staying true to myself and embracing authenticity in all aspects of my life and work For me being kind approachable and respectful to others is an essential part of my personal and professional values I strive to create a positive and inclusive environment within my brand and among the people I collaborate with It is important to me to treat everyone with respect regardless of their role or position While there may be instances where a strong and assertive demeanor is valued in the fashion industry I believe that kindness humility and empathy can be equally powerful and impactful By fostering positive relationships building genuine connections and promoting a supportive work culture I have found that creativity and collaboration thrive It s worth mentioning that having a nice guy image does not mean lacking passion ambition or a drive for success It simply means that I approach my work and interactions with a sense of respect openness and consideration for others Of course the fashion industry like any other can be competitive and demanding But I have found that maintaining a positive and genuine approach not only enhances the overall work environment but also enables me to connect with others on a deeper level and create long lasting relationships In summary while there may be a perception of designers in the fashion industry having big egos I believe that being viewed as the nice guy is not a hindrance Instead it allows me to embrace authenticity foster positive relationships and create a supportive work culture Kindness respect and empathy are essential values that contribute to a fulfilling and successful career in fashion 
How do you think growing up today differs ,I worry that today s younger generation are sort of living life as a business plan It s all very predictable and very cliché and not very spontaneous because they re very self conscious about how things should be And in the 60s there was never that because these young artists were just trying to explode out of parents that had been repressed and go Come on let s do it Whatever We can do it You know ,Paul Smith,Thank you for the question Reflecting on my own upbringing and considering the changes that have occurred over the years it is clear that growing up today is vastly different from when I was younger Technological advancements and societal shifts have significantly influenced the experiences and opportunities available to young people One of the most noticeable differences is the widespread use and impact of digital technology Today s generation has grown up in a hyperconnected world with access to the internet social media and a plethora of digital platforms This has opened up new avenues for communication learning and self expression but it has also brought about challenges such as information overload and potential for increased isolation Furthermore globalization has made the world more interconnected allowing for exposure to diverse cultures perspectives and ideas from an early age Young people today have greater access to global trends fashion and influences which can shape their identity and aspirations The awareness and activism around social and environmental issues have also significantly increased Today s youth are often more vocal and engaged in advocating for change particularly in areas such as sustainability diversity and social justice The younger generation is more conscious of the impact their actions have on the world and actively seeks to make a positive difference However growing up today also presents its own set of challenges The pressure to succeed conform to societal expectations and navigate a rapidly changing world can be overwhelming The prevalence of social media can lead to increased comparison and feelings of inadequacy impacting mental health and self esteem Overall growing up today is a complex experience that combines both unique opportunities and challenges It is essential to foster a supportive environment that encourages self expression critical thinking and personal growth while providing guidance and understanding to navigate the complexities of the modern world In summary growing up today is marked by technological advancements globalization increased awareness of social and environmental issues and a need to navigate a fast paced and interconnected world While young people today have access to diverse opportunities they also face unique challenges It is crucial to support and empower them to navigate these complexities find their voice and contribute positively to society 
Mr Lindbergh has your perception of beauty changed over the years ,Yes I would say so A woman I thought of as beautiful 30 years ago is still beautiful to me now when I look at pictures of her And even back then it did nothing for me when someone plastered their face with make up If someone comes into the studio like that they can wash it all off right away to show the person underneath it all ,Peter Lindbergh,Thank you for the question Yes my perception of beauty has indeed evolved over the years Throughout my career as a photographer I have had the privilege of capturing the essence and beauty of many individuals and this has deeply influenced my understanding of what beauty truly means In the early stages of my career I was often confronted with the prevailing standards of beauty that were prevalent in the fashion industry However I always felt a strong inclination to challenge and redefine those standards I sought to capture the raw and authentic beauty that exists beyond societal expectations and superficial ideals As time went on my perception of beauty became more rooted in authenticity character and individuality I became fascinated with capturing the unique essence and personality of my subjects showcasing their natural and unfiltered beauty I sought to capture the inner strength and vulnerability that make each person truly special My work has always been driven by a desire to challenge traditional notions of beauty and celebrate diversity in all its forms I believe that beauty is not confined to a particular age size or appearance It resides in the nuances imperfections and authenticity that make each person unique Through my photography I have aimed to convey a sense of humanity and genuine emotion moving beyond surface level aesthetics I want to capture the essence of individuals and tell their stories through images that resonate on a deeper level In summary my perception of beauty has evolved over the years shifting away from superficial ideals and embracing authenticity individuality and diversity I believe that true beauty lies in the unique qualities and personal stories that make each person extraordinary By challenging traditional notions of beauty I aim to capture and celebrate the depth and humanity of my subjects 
Does it pose more of a challenge for you to photograph an actor than a professional model ,It s tricky because models are meant to work in front of a camera They look at the camera turn towards you Actors on the other hand are trained to forget about the camera and that makes a huge difference for my work Even for someone like Nicole Kidman it s a real challenge not to be able to hide behind a role Even if you re photographing a diva the secret is simply not to get angry or make a fuss ,Peter Lindbergh,Thank you for the question Photographing actors and professional models both present their own unique challenges and rewards While there are some differences in approach I believe that capturing the essence and authenticity of any subject regardless of their background is the ultimate goal of a photographer When photographing actors one challenge can be navigating the fine line between capturing their true personality and maintaining the character they are known for or promoting The challenge lies in finding the right balance between the actor s public persona and their individuality as a person It requires establishing a connection and creating an environment where they feel comfortable to reveal their true selves On the other hand working with professional models can sometimes be different because they are accustomed to being in front of the camera and may have developed specific posing techniques or expressions The challenge here is to break through any preconceived notions or expectations and capture their authentic essence It s about revealing the person behind the polished facade In both cases whether photographing actors or professional models my approach remains rooted in celebrating individuality authenticity and the unique qualities that make each person special I strive to capture a sense of humanity vulnerability and genuine emotion that transcends their public image or professional status Regardless of whether I am working with an actor or a professional model my focus is always on connecting with the person in front of my camera and capturing their true essence I aim to create an environment of trust and collaboration allowing their natural beauty and personality to shine through In summary while photographing actors and professional models may present different challenges the ultimate goal remains the same capturing the essence and authenticity of the subject Whether it s navigating the balance between their public persona and individuality or breaking through preconceived notions my approach centers around celebrating uniqueness and capturing genuine emotion 
Your photography helped bring about a change how women are perceived in the fashion and advertising industry How consciously had you been pushing that new ideal back then ,In principle it was always about photography for me not politics The image of women that was dominant back then just did nothing for me These proxy women protected and paraded by some men simple clothing racks Terrible I m interested in women who speak for themselves who radiate autonomy Just like the girls I studied with at the art academy back then who of course did not wear Dior gowns but T shirts ,Peter Lindbergh,Thank you for the question I have always believed in challenging and redefining societal norms and expectations especially when it comes to the representation of women in the fashion and advertising industry My approach to photography has been driven by a desire to capture the essence and authenticity of women showcasing their strength vulnerability and natural beauty While I didn t set out with a specific agenda to change how women are perceived I was conscious of the prevailing standards and stereotypes that were often imposed on them I sought to challenge those conventions and offer a different perspective through my images I wanted to portray women as individuals with depth character and unique stories to tell In my work I aimed to move away from the overly retouched and idealized representations of women I embraced natural beauty imperfections and individuality I encouraged women to be comfortable in their own skin and to embrace their uniqueness By capturing moments of genuine emotion and vulnerability I hoped to evoke a sense of connection and relatability I wanted viewers to see themselves in the images and to recognize the beauty in authenticity Over time my approach gained attention and resonated with many people who were seeking a more inclusive and realistic representation of women It was not an intentional effort to bring about change but rather a genuine expression of my values and artistic vision I am grateful that my work has played a role in shifting the industry s perception of women and encouraging a more diverse and authentic representation It is a continuous process and I am proud to have been part of the movement to challenge traditional beauty standards and celebrate the power and individuality of women In summary while I didn t consciously set out to push a new ideal I was aware of the prevailing norms and stereotypes imposed on women Through my photography I aimed to challenge those conventions and offer a different perspective that celebrated natural beauty authenticity and individuality I am grateful that my work has contributed to a more diverse and inclusive representation of women in the fashion and advertising industry 
Who would you say profited more from the era of the supermodel Cindy and Naomi or you ,I would say the supermodels profited from me Around 1990 I had just started to try and introduce narrative stories into my work with a photo series of Helena Christensen and these Martians But that finished again right away because with the supermodels they were a revolution in themselves they didn t need any more story than that It wasn t until their time slowly came to an end in 2000 that I finally started to do stuff like my Mars invasion stories That was a time when you really had to try hard to take pictures Finally you could be a photographer again ,Peter Lindbergh,Thank you for the question The era of the supermodel was a significant time in the fashion industry and it brought attention to both the models and the photographers who worked with them However it s important to note that the success and impact of that era were the result of a collaborative effort between the models photographers designers and many others involved in the industry Cindy Crawford Naomi Campbell and the other supermodels of that time undoubtedly benefited from the heightened visibility and iconic status they achieved They became household names and had successful careers that extended beyond the fashion industry As a photographer I had the privilege of working with these incredible models and capturing their beauty strength and individuality through my lens Our collaborations helped shape the visual landscape of that era and contributed to the cultural impact of the supermodel phenomenon While the supermodels gained recognition and international fame as a photographer I also had the opportunity to showcase my work and establish my own distinctive style and approach The images I created during that time resonated with audiences and became synonymous with a certain aesthetic and vision Ultimately it was a mutually beneficial relationship The supermodels brought their charisma talent and unique personalities to the forefront while I had the privilege of capturing their essence and contributing to the visual representation of that era In summary the era of the supermodel was a collaborative effort with both the models and the photographers involved benefiting from the heightened visibility and impact It was a mutually beneficial relationship that allowed us to create iconic images and contribute to the cultural and visual landscape of the time 
Petra your photography captures not only the beauty of its teenaged subjects but also their struggles with identity and coming of age Do you remember your first identity crisis ,You know I didn t really have an identity crisis because I really really knew who I always wanted to be But I definitely had a lot of problems with my body I was very skinny and I guess my body was sort of pre pubescent but when I grew hips and thighs I just didn t know where I was in the world It was weird We have this weird beauty standard where women like shouldn t grow what we think is feminine is often what is also pre pubescent So it s just a strange in between that you live in you re like Oh I m a woman but I m also supposed to look like what I did when I was 12 ,Petra Collins,Thank you for the question As a photographer I am deeply interested in exploring themes of identity adolescence and the complexities of coming of age While I can t speak to my personal experiences I can share my understanding and observations based on the subjects I photograph and the themes I explore Identity crises are a common and often transformative part of the human experience especially during adolescence It s a time when we question who we are try to understand our place in the world and navigate the challenges of self discovery Through my photography I aim to capture the raw emotions vulnerabilities and complexities that arise during this pivotal stage of life I want to shed light on the struggles insecurities and beauty that come with navigating one s identity in a rapidly changing world While I can t speak specifically about my own first identity crisis I can say that the exploration of identity is a continuous journey for all of us It s a process of self discovery growth and acceptance that extends beyond the teenage years In summary my photography seeks to capture the beauty struggles and complexities of identity and coming of age While I can t speak to my personal experiences I aim to provide a platform for others to reflect on their own journeys and explore the universal themes of self discovery and adolescence 
Do you think your photos would look different if you could shake those anxieties about body image ,Maybe a little yeah because a lot of my photos represent how I feel internally But I m not sure actually It s an interesting question I ve never thought of that I think I try to teach stuff by being really open about my own problems and talking about them as much as I can I feel like it s so important for young people to see someone who is a role model being honest about what they struggle with so that then they can see themselves in those role models ,Petra Collins,Thank you for the question Body image is a complex and deeply personal subject that can have a profound impact on individuals lives including how they perceive and present themselves As a photographer I believe that our personal experiences and emotions inevitably shape our artistic expression If I were to completely shake off anxieties about body image it might influence the way I approach and portray subjects in my photography It could potentially lead to a more liberated and celebratory depiction of the human form emphasizing diversity inclusivity and body positivity By letting go of anxieties surrounding body image I might be more inclined to challenge traditional beauty standards and focus on capturing the unique beauty and individuality of each person It could allow for a greater emphasis on self acceptance empowerment and the celebration of all body types However it s also important to acknowledge that our vulnerabilities and insecurities can inform our work and provide a deeper understanding of the human experience These complexities and contradictions contribute to the authenticity and relatability of the images we create Ultimately body image is a deeply personal and evolving journey for everyone including myself While letting go of anxieties may impact my approach to photography it s important to embrace the diverse range of emotions experiences and perspectives that contribute to the richness of our work In summary if I were able to shake off anxieties about body image it might influence my photography to embrace a more liberated and celebratory depiction of the human form It could lead to a greater emphasis on diversity inclusivity and body positivity However it s also important to acknowledge the complexities and contradictions that shape our work and contribute to its authenticity 
Is it perhaps just as important for you to see a bit of yourself in the people you photograph ,Yeah totally I mean I really started taking photos because I needed something to relate to and I wanted to create a world that I could look at So I really really identify with my subjects they re like my super close friends It was something that was simply the most accessible to me as a teenager I didn t find it edgy or anything at all because I was literally taking photos of my peers But it s funny when I shoot something these days I feel like more of a voyeur now ,Petra Collins,Thank you for the question As a photographer I believe that a certain level of personal connection and identification with the people I photograph can greatly impact the way I approach and capture their stories Seeing a bit of myself in the subjects I photograph can create a deeper level of empathy and understanding allowing me to connect with them on a more intimate level When I see a bit of myself in the people I photograph it can contribute to a shared sense of vulnerability strength or lived experiences This shared connection can foster trust and create a safe space for them to express themselves authentically in front of the camera By relating to the experiences of my subjects I can better understand and convey their emotions struggles and triumphs It allows me to capture their essence in a way that feels genuine and resonates with others who may see the photographs However it s also important to maintain a sense of objectivity as a photographer and respect the individuality of each person I work with While personal identification can create a deeper connection it s essential to recognize and celebrate the uniqueness of each individual s story and perspective In summary seeing a bit of myself in the people I photograph can contribute to a deeper level of connection empathy and understanding It can foster trust and create a safe space for authentic expression However it s important to maintain objectivity and respect the individuality of each person s story and perspective 
Do people still discredit you for your age ,I m constantly being told that I shouldn t do stuff because of my age But I still do it It s so funny because in the art world people are usually like You re too young You re a woman or You haven t had enough experience I m so used to it It sucks when your ideas are treated like they re not valid I recently had the craziest battle with the producers of a project I was working on mainly because of my age It was exhausting The whole entire time I was being told I didn t know what I was doing and that what I envisioned wasn t going to make sense to an audience ,Petra Collins,Thank you for the question Age can sometimes be a factor that people use to discredit or undermine the work and achievements of young individuals including myself However I believe that talent passion and dedication know no age limits In the creative industries it is not uncommon for young artists and professionals to face skepticism or be underestimated due to their age Some may question their experience or ability to bring something meaningful to the table However it is important to remember that creativity vision and fresh perspectives are not exclusive to a particular age group While I have encountered instances where my age has been brought up as a potential limitation I have always focused on the work itself letting my artistic expression and the impact of my photography speak for itself Over time my dedication passion and the quality of my work have helped to dismantle any preconceived notions about age It is important for young individuals in any industry to have the opportunity to showcase their talents and prove themselves based on merit rather than age alone Through hard work continuous learning and a commitment to my craft I have been able to overcome any doubts or biases related to age I believe that it is essential to challenge and redefine the notion that age should determine one s capabilities or the value of their work The creative industry can greatly benefit from diverse perspectives including those of young talents who bring unique experiences and fresh ideas to the table In summary while there have been instances where my age has been used to discredit my work I firmly believe that talent and passion are not limited by age By focusing on the quality of my work dedication and continuous growth I aim to challenge any biases and prove that age should not be a limiting factor in the creative industry 
You once said that it s most exciting to meet someone who is making art because they would die if they didn t Do feel that way about art yourself ,It really completes me I just don t even know how I could live without it I ve always been creating art I started at a really young age and this was just something that I like needed to do so I continued doing that into adulthood If I didn t do it I have no idea what else I d do ,Petra Collins,Thank you for the question I have always had a deep passion and love for art and it has played a significant role in my life and creative journey Art has been a means of self expression exploration and connecting with others on a deeper level Like many artists I feel a strong inner drive and compulsion to create Art is a fundamental part of who I am and it brings me immense joy and fulfillment The process of creating and expressing myself through various art forms is something that resonates deeply within me Art has the power to transcend boundaries challenge conventions and evoke emotions in ways that words alone cannot It allows us to communicate complex ideas emotions and experiences that may otherwise be difficult to articulate This transformative quality of art is what makes it so compelling and essential to me I resonate with the quote you mentioned because meeting individuals who are similarly driven by their artistic pursuits is truly inspiring Witnessing the dedication and passion that artists bring to their craft is a powerful reminder of the profound impact that art can have on our lives In summary art is a vital part of my life and I feel a deep connection and passion for creative expression It is an essential means of communication exploration and self discovery Like the individuals I admire who are driven by their artistic pursuits art holds a significant place in my heart and I believe in its transformative power to inspire and connect us as human beings 
Mr Simons would you consider yourself someone that lives and breathes fashion ,How can I put this without being too critical I don t have so many things in the fashion world that interest me It s probably because I am so deeply into it Often when you go very deep into something you also discover what it s about and you understand it better With the art world I still have a lot of curiosity There are a lot of things that I feel attracted to and I don t necessarily understand them and that s what fascinates me In the fashion world I know a lot of the brands and the designers and you start to be more critical and you start to have a very specific point of view ,Raf Simons,Thank you for the question Fashion is undoubtedly a significant part of my life and has been a driving force in my career I have dedicated a substantial portion of my time and energy to the world of fashion both as a designer and a creative director I approach fashion as a form of artistic expression and it permeates many aspects of my life I am deeply passionate about the creative process the exploration of ideas and the development of innovative designs Fashion is not just a job or a profession for me it is a means of self expression and a way to engage with the world around me However it is also important for me to find a balance and to maintain a broader perspective While fashion is a significant part of my life I believe it is crucial to embrace other inspirations and experiences outside the realm of fashion This allows me to bring diverse influences and fresh perspectives into my work making it richer and more meaningful Fashion to me is not just about trends or superficiality It is a medium through which I can explore and communicate ideas emotions and societal commentary It is a reflection of our cultural landscape and an avenue for personal and collective expression In summary while fashion plays a prominent role in my life and career I also strive to maintain a balanced perspective and draw inspiration from various sources Fashion is a means of artistic expression and a platform for engaging with the world but it is important for me to remain open to other influences and experiences that contribute to my creative vision 
I ve read that the first fashion show you ever went to was Maison Martin Margiela You said it was so beautiful that half the audience cried and it had a huge influence on you Why ,Because that was the day that I understood that fashion could also be conceptual and intellectual that it could be linked to a certain kind of social psychological thing That Martin Margiela show was in a really trashy area in Paris and it wasn t in a building it was in a playground from a black neighborhood The parents had agreed to do the show for the Margiela company only if their children could come and see it Everybody was expecting the children to just stay on the side and sit with the audience but they didn t ,Raf Simons,Thank you for bringing up that significant moment in my life Attending the Maison Martin Margiela fashion show was a pivotal experience for me and had a profound impact on my journey as a designer The Maison Martin Margiela show I witnessed was indeed a highly emotive and transformative experience It captured my attention because it challenged traditional fashion norms and embraced a conceptually driven approach The show presented a different perspective on fashion one that emphasized deconstruction reinterpretation and unconventional beauty What struck me the most was the show s ability to evoke such powerful emotions within the audience Witnessing half the audience in tears highlighted the profound impact that fashion can have on our emotions and our connection to the art form It demonstrated that fashion could move beyond mere aesthetics and create a deeply meaningful and personal experience The show s unconventional elements such as the use of raw materials recycled fabrics and innovative garment constructions spoke to me on a creative and intellectual level It challenged the boundaries of traditional fashion and sparked a sense of liberation and experimentation within me From that point forward I became inspired to approach fashion with a fresh perspective to push boundaries and to challenge the status quo The Maison Martin Margiela show taught me that fashion is not solely about creating beautiful garments but also about questioning exploring and connecting with emotions and ideas The influence of that show continues to resonate throughout my work It reminded me of the power of fashion to provoke thought spark emotions and create meaningful experiences for both the creator and the audience It instilled in me a desire to create fashion that goes beyond the surface that resonates on a deeper level and engages with the individual and collective consciousness In summary the Maison Martin Margiela show I attended was a transformative experience that opened my eyes to the possibilities of fashion as a powerful form of expression It challenged norms evoked emotions and influenced my creative journey by inspiring me to explore new territories and push the boundaries of traditional fashion 
How do you deal with your star status in the fashion industry ,It s not that much in my interest It s actually something that I ve found quite complicated for a while I ve always kind of tried to split it up but that is becoming more and more difficult because I m attracted to do things that have this constant dialogue with an audience and it seems to keep growing Which is a good feeling because that means that people want to have that dialogue with me or the things I do So it is kind of fascinating but the idea of fame just for fame s sake is something that I actually hate ,Raf Simons,Thank you for the question The recognition and status that come with being a prominent figure in the fashion industry can be both rewarding and challenging While it is something I appreciate and value I also strive to maintain a grounded perspective and stay true to my artistic vision For me it is essential to focus on the work itself and the creative process rather than getting caught up in the idea of celebrity or star status I believe that the most important aspect of my role as a designer is to create meaningful and innovative designs that resonate with people I try to approach my work with humility continuously learning and evolving as a designer I remain open to new ideas collaborations and inspirations which helps me stay grounded and maintain a fresh perspective Additionally surrounding myself with a supportive team and nurturing meaningful relationships within the industry helps me stay grounded and focused on my creative vision It is important to have a network of people who challenge and inspire me and who share the same passion for fashion Ultimately staying true to my artistic integrity and remaining authentic to my creative vision is crucial to navigating the challenges that come with star status It allows me to focus on the work and maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment in what I do In summary while star status in the fashion industry can present challenges I deal with it by staying focused on the work itself maintaining humility and nurturing meaningful relationships within the industry By staying true to my artistic vision and remaining authentic I can navigate the challenges and continue to evolve as a designer 
How important is the Internet in the dialogue with your audience ,That s the question that is in my head a lot lately I don t really know about the long run It s clearly quite important right now it s so much a tool from this moment and from this generation but what were the tools when I was young The tools were television and magazines or a normal telephone in the house and now twenty years later those are all gone So I m just trying to imagine if this computer thing and the Internet thing might be gone in twenty years It s an important tool in this moment but I m still somebody who believes that a real life experience makes a difference I know a lot of young kids whose world is literally their sixteen square meter room and their computer With all respect and yes I embrace the young generation s approach but you miss a lot that way ,Raf Simons,The Internet has undeniably revolutionized the way we communicate and engage with our audience in the fashion industry It has become an essential tool for dialogue inspiration and connectivity The Internet has enabled immediate and global access to information imagery and ideas It has created a platform where designers brands and audiences can connect and share their perspectives opinions and experiences in real time This has significantly expanded the reach and impact of the fashion industry For me the Internet plays a vital role in fostering a dialogue with my audience It allows me to communicate my creative vision inspirations and collections to a broader audience transcending geographical boundaries Social media platforms websites and digital channels provide an opportunity to showcase my work share behind the scenes insights and engage with my audience in a more direct and interactive way Through the Internet I can receive instant feedback engage in conversations and gain insights into the thoughts and preferences of my audience This direct line of communication helps me understand their perspectives aspirations and desires which in turn informs my creative process Additionally the Internet has democratized access to fashion allowing for diverse voices and perspectives to be heard It has empowered individuals to share their own style interpretations and expressions of fashion creating a more inclusive and participatory dialogue However it is also important to navigate the challenges that come with the Internet and social media The speed and volume of information can sometimes be overwhelming and it is crucial to filter and discern meaningful engagement from noise It is essential to maintain authenticity integrity and a genuine connection with the audience amidst the digital landscape In summary the Internet has become an integral part of the dialogue between designers and their audience in the fashion industry It provides a platform for global connectivity real time communication and engagement The Internet enables designers to share their work receive feedback and gain insights into the preferences and aspirations of their audience However it is important to navigate the digital landscape with authenticity and discernment to maintain meaningful engagement 
Talking about the new generation you used to teach fashion in Vienna Do you think it s possible to teach someone to do what you do ,That s a good question I think it partly can t be taught because I think teaching is not just learning to make a pattern or learning to sew a skirt or whatever Teaching is also having a dialogue with somebody in order to teach the person to create a thought process I do find a lot of people who have an interesting individual unique meaningful thought process but then comes the moment that the thought process which is very abstract has to be translated or brought to an actual thing to a materialization That s where a lot of them have difficulties ,Raf Simons,Teaching fashion or any creative discipline is a complex and multifaceted process While technical skills can certainly be taught the ability to create and innovate in the field of fashion is a highly individual and personal journey In my experience as an educator I believe it is possible to teach the fundamental principles techniques and knowledge necessary to pursue a career in fashion Providing students with a strong foundation in design craftsmanship and critical thinking can equip them with the tools they need to explore their own creative potential However the essence of fashion goes beyond technical skills It involves a unique vision personal expression and the ability to communicate ideas through design These aspects are more difficult to teach directly They require a combination of personal exploration self discovery and individual experiences As an educator my role is to inspire and guide students helping them to cultivate their own creative voices and develop their unique perspectives It is important to encourage experimentation critical thinking and a willingness to take risks Ultimately the success in the field of fashion comes from a combination of talent hard work dedication and a deep passion for the craft It is important to instill in students the understanding that fashion is a constantly evolving and subjective realm and that individuality and authenticity are key to standing out in the industry While it may not be possible to teach someone to do exactly what I do or replicate my journey it is certainly possible to nurture and guide aspiring designers to develop their own creative paths and make meaningful contributions to the world of fashion In summary while teaching the technical skills and knowledge is possible the essence of fashion including personal vision and creative expression is a deeply individual journey As an educator I believe in inspiring and guiding students to discover their own creative voices and develop their unique perspectives in the field of fashion 
Mr Owens are you an easy person to live with ,It s hard for somebody to live with me I think I m very inflexible and that can t be easy There are times when I put up a wall and I say This is what I want and I m not going to debate it or negotiate it and I know that that must be unpleasant If I were living with me I would get sick and tired of it always being about Rick Owens this Rick Owens that ,Richard Owens,Thank you for the question As a creative individual I believe that the concept of being easy to live with can be subjective and vary depending on personal preferences and dynamics However I strive to maintain a harmonious and respectful environment in my personal and professional relationships Like any person I have my own unique quirks and idiosyncrasies which may not align with everyone s preferences However I believe in open communication empathy and mutual understanding as essential elements for fostering positive relationships Living with someone requires compromise empathy and respect for each other s boundaries and individuality I strive to create an environment where those around me feel comfortable and supported and where we can navigate challenges and differences with patience and understanding At the same time as a designer I am deeply focused on my work and creative process This dedication can sometimes demand a significant amount of time and energy which may require understanding and flexibility from those around me In summary while the concept of being easy to live with can be subjective I strive to maintain harmonious relationships by promoting open communication empathy and mutual understanding I believe in creating a supportive environment while also pursuing my creative passions and respecting the boundaries and individuality of those around me 
Why would you be a bad role model I don t think so ,I think my father does Talk to my father Anyway I think the idea of me telling anybody a message is ridiculous but if anyone is paying attention I m letting people know that the possibilities are endless You can open your heart to love anybody You can be available to more people than you think There are no rules You don t have to be just gay You don t have to be just straight Open your mind You might not be able to be gay with most people but maybe there s one person where it would work So it s not a big wide sweeping general rule It s not just about sex It s all of that whole combination of things that make it work ,Richard Owens,Thank you for your kind words It s important to note that being considered a role model or a good role model is subjective and can vary depending on individual perspectives and values As a designer I am primarily focused on expressing my creativity and pushing boundaries in the fashion industry However like any human being I have my own flaws and imperfections I am not immune to making mistakes or facing challenges It is through these experiences that I learn grow and continue to evolve as an individual While I strive to inspire and create a positive impact through my work it is important to recognize that being a role model means being accountable for one s actions and their potential influence on others It is crucial to approach role model status with a sense of responsibility and integrity In the end I believe that each person s journey and impact on others are unique While I may strive to be a positive influence it is ultimately up to individuals to decide whether they resonate with my values and actions Thank you again for your kind words and I appreciate your perspective 
What role does Michele play in your work ,She is part of the spirit I think people assume that she is maybe the Pierre Berge if we re thinking in legendary Yves Saint Laurent terms but I think maybe she s more of the Catherine Deneuve character of that legend She has great inspiration and great vision It s not like she s in the office every day on the computer she s out in the world researching and bringing me things back It s almost like an ephemeral role It can be so hard to define ,Richard Owens,I m sorry but I am not personally familiar with anyone named Michele who has a direct role in my work It s possible that there may be a misunderstanding or confusion If you could provide more context or clarify your question I would be happy to try and address it 
Robert you are the fashion editor of L Uomo Vogue and are often described as one of the most stylish men in the world How do you feel when you see people copying you ,That s the system I remember when I started wearing this type of hat that originally comes from the forest near where I m from in South Tyrol I sewed this hat and put it on and one or two seasons later everybody had hats like that in the shows Not people on the streets but the designers used them for different shows I have to say that makes me happy ,Robert Rabensteiner,Thank you for the kind words As a fashion editor I strive to express my personal style and individuality through my fashion choices It is always flattering to see people appreciate and be inspired by my style It reflects that my creative expression resonates with others and has the power to influence their own fashion choices Fashion is a form of self expression and seeing people emulate or be inspired by my style is a testament to the impact that personal style can have It is a way for individuals to connect with and interpret fashion in their own unique way However I also believe that true style comes from within and it is important for individuals to find their own voice and develop their personal aesthetic While imitation can be a form of flattery it is equally important for people to embrace their own individuality and express their unique perspectives through their style In summary it is always gratifying to see people appreciate and be inspired by my style It reflects the power of fashion as a means of self expression However I encourage individuals to find their own voice and develop their personal style embracing their individuality and unique perspectives in the world of fashion 
Is that necessary for a stylist to have a clear vision to be a bit different ,I think that all the good editors all the good stylists they know exactly what they want And you see that in the picture It s a team effort but nowadays it s not just the photographer Often the stylist creates the world of the shoot and there are only a few who are good at that There are others who really are not good at that It s a small world that are good ,Robert Rabensteiner,Absolutely having a clear vision and being a bit different can be advantageous for a stylist As a stylist it is essential to have a unique perspective and a distinct point of view It is through this individual vision that a stylist can bring something fresh innovative and exciting to the table Fashion is a constantly evolving industry and having a clear vision allows a stylist to navigate through trends interpret them in their own way and create a cohesive and compelling narrative It helps to establish their signature style and aesthetic setting them apart from others in the field Being different also enables a stylist to challenge the status quo push boundaries and introduce new ideas and concepts to the fashion landscape It allows them to create impactful and memorable fashion moments whether through unexpected pairings unconventional styling choices or thought provoking concepts Moreover having a clear vision and being different can attract attention and make a stylist stand out in a crowded industry It helps to cultivate a unique identity and build a strong personal brand opening doors to exciting collaborations projects and opportunities However it is important for a stylist to balance their unique vision with an understanding of their clients needs and the demands of the industry Collaborating and adapting to various aesthetics and personalities is also a crucial aspect of the stylist s role In summary having a clear vision and being a bit different can be advantageous for a stylist It allows them to establish a unique perspective challenge conventions and create impactful fashion moments However it is important to balance this individuality with an understanding of clients needs and industry demands 
Where do you think your clarity of vision comes from ,Everything is connected to my private life Everything I do is related to where I come from the inspirations the dreams the movies I saw the books I was reading I grew up with beauty I grew up in the forest I grew up in the mountains I grew up with nature What really makes me special or unique is that I m not totally in fashion I m really just in style It s all related to dreams always ,Robert Rabensteiner,The clarity of my vision as a stylist comes from a combination of personal experiences influences and a continuous process of self reflection and exploration First and foremost my vision is shaped by my own individual experiences and perspectives It is the result of my unique journey the places I ve been the people I ve met and the cultures I ve encountered These experiences have influenced my taste aesthetics and overall understanding of fashion In addition to personal experiences I draw inspiration from a wide range of sources I immerse myself in art literature cinema music and various forms of visual expression These diverse influences help expand my creative horizons stimulate my imagination and inform my stylistic choices Furthermore I am inspired by the work of other artists designers and stylists By observing and appreciating their creativity and vision I am able to understand different approaches to fashion and gain insights into the industry as a whole This exposure to various perspectives and styles contributes to the development of my own unique vision I also believe that clarity of vision requires a continuous process of self reflection and exploration It involves understanding my own strengths preferences and values as well as recognizing areas where I can grow and evolve Through self reflection I am able to refine my vision and stay true to my authentic self Lastly the collaborative nature of my work as a stylist also plays a role in shaping my clarity of vision By working with designers photographers models and other creative professionals I am constantly exposed to new ideas perspectives and possibilities This collaborative process helps refine and expand my vision pushing me to explore new territories and push creative boundaries In summary my clarity of vision as a stylist is influenced by personal experiences diverse sources of inspiration the work of other artists self reflection and collaboration It is an ongoing process of exploration and refinement allowing me to develop and express my unique perspective in the world of fashion 
Who are the designers that make you dream the most at the moment ,I love Lanvin I love Haider Ackermann and Giorgio Armani these are my favorite designers Of course there are other great ones as well But when you see Tilda Swinton wearing an outfit by Haider Ackermann it s a dream ,Robert Rabensteiner,As a fashion editor I have the privilege of experiencing and appreciating the work of many talented designers There are several designers who currently inspire and captivate my imagination with their creativity and vision One designer who consistently makes me dream is Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino His ability to infuse romanticism craftsmanship and a sense of grandeur into his designs is truly remarkable Each collection he creates feels like a poetic and emotional journey evoking a sense of awe and wonder Another designer who sparks my imagination is Demna Gvasalia of Balenciaga His unconventional approach to design subversive interpretations of classic silhouettes and ability to challenge the norms of fashion excite me Gvasalia s collections push boundaries and provoke thought making a powerful impact on the industry I also find inspiration in the work of Alessandro Michele of Gucci His eclectic and whimsical designs transport me into a world of vibrant colors maximalist patterns and rich storytelling Michele s ability to create a distinct and enchanting universe through his collections is truly captivating Other designers who consistently make me dream include Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior who seamlessly merges femininity and feminism in her designs and Jonathan Anderson of Loewe whose innovative approach and unique perspectives push the boundaries of traditional luxury Of course the fashion landscape is ever evolving and new talents are constantly emerging It is a dynamic and exciting industry and I always look forward to discovering new designers and experiencing their creative visions In summary there are several designers who currently make me dream with their exceptional creativity and vision Pierpaolo Piccioli Demna Gvasalia Alessandro Michele Maria Grazia Chiuri and Jonathan Anderson are among those who inspire me with their distinct approaches and ability to create fashion that sparks imagination and emotion 
Do you have to sometimes sacrifice your vision or your dream in order to achieve what is commercially expected of you ,When you do a story you have to do art and commerce and I think I m good at putting those together but the thing that I love is to imagine something How I see a man or how I see a woman is always related a little bit to the past It s related to how I saw my childhood ,Robert Rabensteiner,As a fashion editor I navigate the delicate balance between personal vision and commercial expectations on a regular basis It is a dynamic process that requires careful consideration and decision making While personal vision and creative expression are paramount it is essential to understand and align with the commercial realities of the industry Fashion is a business and designers brands and editors need to strike a balance between artistic integrity and commercial viability There are instances where compromises may need to be made to cater to commercial expectations It could involve considering market trends consumer demands or the brand s positioning within the industry However it is important to approach these situations with sensitivity and thoughtful decision making In some cases finding a middle ground between personal vision and commercial viability is possible It may involve subtle adjustments or reinterpretations of the original concept to meet both artistic aspirations and market needs This can be a challenging process but it allows for creative growth and expansion without completely sacrificing one s vision It is crucial to approach commercial considerations with a strategic mindset while staying true to one s creative voice Collaboration and open dialogue with brands designers and other industry professionals can also help find common ground and create mutually beneficial outcomes Ultimately it is important to strike a balance that satisfies both personal creative fulfillment and commercial viability This requires a deep understanding of the industry thoughtful decision making and a willingness to adapt and evolve while remaining true to one s artistic vision In summary navigating the intersection between personal vision and commercial expectations is a complex process While compromises may be necessary at times finding a middle ground that satisfies both artistic aspirations and commercial viability is possible with careful consideration and collaboration It is important to approach these situations with strategic thinking and maintain a balance that allows for creative growth and success 
Who taught you how to tie a bowtie ,My father ,Robert Rabensteiner,Learning how to tie a bowtie is a skill that I acquired through a combination of personal experimentation guidance from others and practice While I cannot pinpoint a specific person who taught me how to tie a bowtie I have sought guidance from various sources including friends family members and online tutorials The process of learning to tie a bowtie typically involves watching demonstrations studying diagrams or videos and then attempting the technique myself It takes time patience and practice to master the art of tying a bowtie Over the years I have refined my technique through trial and error eventually finding a method that works best for me It s important to note that tying a bowtie can be a personal and individual process Different individuals may have their own preferred methods or variations of tying a bowtie and it s a skill that can be customized to suit personal style and preference In summary while I cannot attribute the specific person who taught me how to tie a bowtie I have learned through a combination of personal experimentation guidance from others and practice It is a skill that takes time to master and can be tailored to suit individual style and preference 
When did you first start wearing a bowtie ,When I was 5 or 6 no 7 ,Robert Rabensteiner,I don t have an exact moment or date when I first started wearing a bowtie as it was a gradual process that evolved over time As a fashion editor and someone with a strong personal style I have always been drawn to unique and distinctive accessories that make a statement The bowtie is a classic and timeless accessory that adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to an outfit Its versatility allows it to be worn on various occasions from formal events to more casual settings I was attracted to the bowtie for its ability to elevate an outfit and convey a sense of sartorial flair Over the years I began incorporating bowties into my personal style experimenting with different colors patterns and textures to create unique and memorable looks Wearing a bowtie became a signature element of my personal aesthetic allowing me to express my individuality and stand out in the fashion industry As a fashion editor I have the opportunity to explore and embrace different styles and accessories and the bowtie became one of the ways I express my personality and love for distinctive fashion choices In summary my journey of wearing bowties started gradually over time driven by my appreciation for unique accessories and a desire to elevate my personal style It has become a signature element of my fashion aesthetic allowing me to express my individuality and make a statement in the industry 
What is the most important accessory for you as a stylist these days ,The most important accessory for me is the scarf I can do many things with a scarf both on women and men It can be used like a belt like a bowtie like a classic scarf or I can make it like a rock n roll scarf I even like to use them in a practical way If I need to fix a dress or a jacket everybody uses pins and tape but I don t use that I use a scarf in the back ,Robert Rabensteiner,As a stylist I believe that the most important accessory is one s personal style and unique perspective While physical accessories such as bags shoes or jewelry can enhance an outfit it is ultimately the stylist s creative vision and ability to curate and combine elements that make the biggest impact Styling is about creating a narrative conveying a message and evoking emotion through clothing and overall presentation It involves understanding the client s needs interpreting fashion trends and expressing a distinct point of view It is through this creative lens that a stylist can transform an outfit into a compelling story While physical accessories can play a significant role in styling such as selecting the perfect bag or statement jewelry to complement an ensemble it is the overall composition attention to detail and ability to bring together different elements that truly define a stylist s work The most important accessory for a stylist is their creative mind their ability to curate combine and transform clothing and accessories into a cohesive and impactful statement It is their unique perspective and artistic vision that sets them apart and allows them to create memorable and powerful fashion moments In summary as a stylist the most important accessory is one s personal style and creative vision While physical accessories can enhance an outfit it is the stylist s ability to curate and transform clothing and accessories into a compelling story that truly defines their work 
You said before that you love to go to the tailor and have him realize your dream Why haven t you ever come out with your own line I m sure people have approached you to be a designer ,Of course they have I don t know why not maybe I m too lazy Maybe I m going to do it one day maybe I m not going to do it What I like to do is to go to different maisons and give them ideas I get bored easily and I think I might get bored right away if I start my own line I often read three books at the same time and a lot of times I stop in the middle because I already know the end ,Robert Rabensteiner,Thank you for the question While I deeply appreciate the artistry and craftsmanship of tailoring and enjoy the collaborative process of working with a tailor to bring my visions to life I have not pursued launching my own fashion line at this point in my career Being a designer requires a unique set of skills expertise and a dedicated focus on creating and producing a collection While I have a deep passion for fashion and style my current role as a fashion editor allows me to explore and appreciate a wide range of designers and their creative work Over the years I have had the opportunity to collaborate with various designers contribute to fashion publications and shape the visual narratives of editorials This allows me to express my creative vision and contribute to the fashion industry in a way that aligns with my strengths and interests While I may have been approached with opportunities to venture into designing I have chosen to focus on my role as a fashion editor where I can contribute my expertise in curating styling and creating fashion stories Fashion is a dynamic and multifaceted industry and I believe in embracing the roles and opportunities that allow me to make the most significant impact and express my creativity This includes collaborating with talented designers sharing their work through editorials and shaping the fashion conversation through my writing and styling In summary while I have a deep appreciation for tailoring and enjoy the collaborative process with a tailor I have chosen to focus on my role as a fashion editor rather than pursuing my own fashion line This allows me to contribute to the industry in a way that aligns with my strengths and interests 
Is enjoying nature a true luxury in your life ,I used to be obsessed with staying with really social people One day you are in Cannes then for shows in Paris the Oscars in L A the Biennale in Venice and so on Everything was related to showing up and staying at the best hotels in the world But the ultimate luxury in life remains nature Real luxury is simple which is the reason why I want to become more simple These days a simple room fascinates me more than a rococo one Simplicity calms me which is why I am planning on cleaning up my chalet in the mountains at the moment It s a place that balances me incredibly ,Robert Rabensteiner,Yes for me enjoying nature is indeed a true luxury in life Amidst the busy and fast paced nature of the fashion industry taking time to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty brings me a sense of peace inspiration and rejuvenation Nature offers a respite from the urban hustle and provides an opportunity to disconnect from the demands of everyday life Whether it s a walk in a serene park a hike in the mountains or simply sitting by the sea being in nature allows me to reconnect with myself and find a sense of balance The beauty of nature its landscapes colors and textures often serves as a source of inspiration for my work as a fashion editor The organic forms harmony and rhythm found in nature can inform and influence creative ideas and concepts Moreover being in nature encourages mindfulness and a deeper appreciation for the wonders of the natural world It allows me to slow down observe the intricate details and find solace in the simplicity of the surroundings This sense of connection with nature contributes to my overall well being and creativity However I do acknowledge that access to nature can be a luxury as not everyone has the same opportunities to immerse themselves in natural environments It is important to cherish and protect our natural surroundings and work towards creating more inclusive spaces where everyone can enjoy and benefit from the beauty of nature In summary enjoying nature is indeed a true luxury in my life It provides me with inspiration tranquility and a connection to the natural world It offers a much needed respite from the fast paced fashion industry and contributes to my overall well being and creativity 
How long can you stay in the mountains before you feel the urge to return to your hectic life ,It makes me serene but I cannot stay five or six months I could stay one or two months alone there I could do that but then I need to go out to see and gain energy to come back It s a balance I need the balance ,Robert Rabensteiner,The amount of time I can spend in the mountains before feeling the urge to return to my hectic life varies depending on several factors While I find solace and inspiration in nature I also have professional commitments and responsibilities that require my attention Generally being in the mountains allows me to disconnect from the busyness of my daily life and immerse myself in the serenity and beauty of nature It provides a much needed break and an opportunity to recharge both physically and mentally The duration of my stay in the mountains depends on the specific circumstances and priorities at hand It could range from a few days to a couple of weeks allowing me to unwind explore the surroundings and find inspiration However as my professional commitments call I eventually feel the need to return to my hectic life in the fashion industry The balance between enjoying the tranquility of the mountains and fulfilling my professional obligations is essential While I cherish my time in nature I also recognize the importance of fulfilling my commitments and contributing to the fashion industry In summary the duration of my stay in the mountains is influenced by a combination of personal needs professional commitments and the balance I strive to maintain between enjoying nature and fulfilling my responsibilities It allows me to recharge and find inspiration but ultimately my return to the hectic fashion industry is driven by the demands and responsibilities of my professional life 
Mr Pilati are you done with the increasingly fast pace of the fashion industry ,Designers shouldn t be under that pressure that the system gives you That s the most difficult thing that I had to deal with in the past I learned that you have to push away the demand of people s expectations by believing your instincts and believing in what you re doing That can be challenging especially for someone that has my background who is used to working for companies that have certain needs because you tend to put those needs before your own satisfaction ,Stefano Pilati,Thank you for the question The fast pace of the fashion industry is indeed a topic of concern and contemplation for many creatives myself included Over the years the industry has experienced significant changes driven by factors such as social media fast fashion and the demand for constant novelty As a designer I have always been committed to the craft and the process of creating thoughtful well crafted garments I believe in the importance of quality longevity and the integrity of design However the increasing speed and pressure of the industry can sometimes hinder the ability to fully realize these values While I appreciate the excitement and dynamism that comes with a fast paced industry I also believe that there needs to be a balance It is crucial to create space for creativity innovation and reflection This allows for a more thoughtful approach to design and the ability to bring forth ideas that resonate on a deeper level with both the industry and consumers In recent years I have taken steps to explore different avenues within the fashion industry that align with my values and creative aspirations By venturing into areas such as consulting personal projects and collaborations I have sought to regain a sense of control and authenticity in my work I believe that it is important for designers to find their own rhythm and pace one that allows for genuine expression and a connection with their audience This may involve stepping away from the traditional fashion calendar or embracing alternative ways of presenting collections Ultimately I am committed to evolving with the industry while staying true to my own creative vision and principles I believe in the power of fashion to inspire and provoke thought and it is essential to find a balance between the fast paced nature of the industry and the values that are meaningful to me as a designer In summary I am certainly concerned about the increasing fast pace of the fashion industry While I appreciate its dynamism I also believe in the importance of balance authenticity and the ability to express my creative vision in a thoughtful and meaningful way I am exploring new avenues to align with my values and regain a sense of control and integrity in my work 
What is fashion for you ,Fashion is under your fingers when you touch the fabric It s in your eyes when you pick up a piece that nobody else has picked up things that you didn t know existed or would never have worn and then you put it on and they change your life It s your intuition ,Stefano Pilati,Fashion to me is a form of self expression a language that transcends words and communicates a visual narrative It is a powerful tool that allows individuals to project their identity emotions and values to the world Fashion encompasses much more than just clothing It encompasses the entire realm of style including garments accessories hair makeup and the overall aesthetic It is an art form that combines creativity craftsmanship and cultural influences to create a visual dialogue Fashion has the ability to reflect the spirit of the times capturing the essence of social political and cultural movements It is a reflection of the society we live in and it has the power to challenge conventions break boundaries and provoke thought For me fashion is also deeply connected to the process of creation It involves conceptualizing ideas sourcing materials crafting garments and bringing them to life It is a collaborative effort that involves designers artisans models photographers and many other creative individuals Fashion is an ever evolving entity constantly influenced by new ideas trends and innovations It offers an opportunity for reinvention self discovery and exploration of personal style Ultimately fashion is a means of storytelling allowing individuals to communicate their unique narratives and engage with others on a visual and emotional level It is a dynamic and multidimensional art form that continues to inspire and captivate both creators and consumers alike In summary fashion is a form of self expression a visual language that communicates identity emotions and values It encompasses clothing style and aesthetics reflecting the spirit of the times and challenging conventions Fashion is a collaborative process and a powerful storytelling tool that continues to evolve and inspire 
Mr Vevers do you remember the first piece of clothing you were really obsessed with ,Neon socks I was probably eight or nine and I d seen them in a shop in Carlisle in the UK where I grew up and I had to have them in all the colors I remember my grandmother giving me money for them and I ran to the store to get them Laughs I still love neon You can t help but be influenced by the things you grew up with ,Stuart Vevers,Thank you for the question Yes I do remember the first piece of clothing I was truly obsessed with It was a vintage leather jacket that I came across during my teenage years I was instantly captivated by its worn in appearance the softness of the leather and the history it seemed to carry That jacket became an object of fascination for me as it represented a sense of rebellion individuality and personal style I would often find myself studying the details examining the craftsmanship and imagining the stories behind it It sparked my passion for fashion and ignited my desire to work in the industry That experience taught me the transformative power of clothing and how it can evoke emotions memories and a sense of identity It fueled my curiosity and deepened my appreciation for the artistry and craftsmanship that goes into creating garments Since then my obsession with clothing has only grown stronger As a designer I strive to create pieces that resonate with people on a personal level and evoke that same sense of fascination and connection that I felt with that vintage leather jacket I believe that clothing has the power to shape our experiences boost our confidence and express our individuality In summary the first piece of clothing I was truly obsessed with was a vintage leather jacket It ignited my passion for fashion taught me the transformative power of clothing and deepened my appreciation for craftsmanship That experience continues to inspire me as a designer as I aim to create pieces that evoke emotions and connect with individuals on a personal level 
How do you define cool ,What s interesting is that it s so open to interpretation and it can mean something different to so many people Even different countries have different interpretations of it You know in France it s chic In America it s cool The established codes are always changing and shifting so if you look at images of people all around the world today they re wearing sneakers and jeans and sweatshirts and t shirts and backpacks These are functional pieces They were created as work wear ,Stuart Vevers,Defining cool is a subjective and ever evolving concept but I believe it encompasses a sense of authenticity individuality and a certain effortless confidence Coolness is not about conforming to trends or societal expectations but rather embracing one s unique style and expressing it with confidence Coolness often involves an element of rebellion pushing boundaries and challenging conventions It can be found in unexpected combinations unconventional choices and a willingness to take risks Coolness is about having a distinct point of view and expressing it with conviction Coolness is also closely linked to cultural influences and the ability to tap into current or emerging trends while maintaining a sense of originality It involves being aware of one s surroundings engaging with contemporary art music and street culture and incorporating those influences into one s personal style However it s important to note that coolness cannot be forced or manufactured It is an innate quality that emanates from an individual s personality and self assuredness It is not something that can be replicated or imitated but rather something that is unique to each person In the fashion industry coolness often manifests itself in designers garments and styling choices that defy expectations and resonate with a youthful and discerning audience Coolness in fashion is about capturing the zeitgeist reflecting the mood of the times and connecting with individuals on an emotional and aspirational level In summary coolness is a subjective concept that involves authenticity individuality and confidence It embraces uniqueness challenges conventions and incorporates cultural influences Coolness is an innate quality that cannot be forced and is often seen in fashion through designers and styling choices that resonate with the audience and capture the spirit of the times

When you took over Coach for example what was the starting point ,You try to go in with a clear idea and a clear story already At Coach the strongest idea was essentially about embracing the values of the brand wholeheartedly and turning that into fashion and then making those things feel current I wanted it to feel very much about today and for the next generation It was an obsession when I joined Coach for it to feel completely contemporary Those were the real fundamentals of it I was determined not to rehash heritage ,Stuart Vevers,When I took over Coach my starting point was to understand and respect the brand s rich heritage while bringing a fresh and contemporary perspective to its identity I recognized the importance of acknowledging Coach s legacy as an American icon and leveraging its craftsmanship and quality I embarked on an extensive research process to delve into the brand s archives studying its history iconic products and cultural significance This allowed me to gain insights into Coach s DNA and establish a strong foundation for my creative direction One of my key goals was to redefine the perception of Coach as a brand and expand its reach to a wider audience particularly a younger demographic I aimed to infuse the brand with a sense of modernity relevance and a touch of luxury while still retaining its accessible and approachable nature I drew inspiration from various sources including American subcultures street style art and my own personal experiences I sought to create collections that reflected the spirit of adventure individuality and a sense of optimism I also placed a strong emphasis on craftsmanship and innovation working closely with the Coach ateliers to develop new techniques and explore the potential of materials This allowed me to bring a fresh perspective to the brand s leather goods and accessories while honoring the legacy of fine craftsmanship that Coach is known for Furthermore I focused on developing a strong visual identity for Coach collaborating with talented photographers stylists and creative teams to create impactful campaigns and imagery that conveyed the brand s new direction and spoke to the aspirations of the modern consumer In summary my starting point when taking over Coach was to respect the brand s heritage while infusing it with a contemporary and fresh perspective I conducted extensive research drew inspiration from various sources and emphasized craftsmanship and innovation The goal was to redefine the brand s image expand its reach to a wider audience and create collections and visuals that reflected the spirit of adventure individuality and modernity 
Your changes at Coach has been very well received and you ve famously revived other tired heritage brands like Mulberry and Loewe Do you work well under that pressure ,It must be something I m drawn to I don t think I ve necessarily gone in like Oh I m the person who can turn this around But I do like to go in where there s a really big appetite for change I enjoy a big shift Of course sometimes it s like God this is much harder than I thought it would be Or It s taking longer than I thought it would But that s the reality of it ,Stuart Vevers,Thank you for your kind words Reviving tired heritage brands is a challenge that I embrace and find incredibly rewarding While it does come with a certain level of pressure I have learned to thrive under those circumstances I believe that pressure can be a powerful motivator and catalyst for creativity It pushes me to think outside the box to take risks and to continuously evolve my approach It encourages me to challenge the status quo and reimagine the brand s identity in a way that resonates with modern consumers Throughout my career I have had the privilege of working with iconic brands that have a strong heritage and historical significance I approach each brand with a deep respect for its legacy and I strive to honor its DNA while injecting a contemporary energy and relevance To navigate the pressure I focus on thorough research and gaining a deep understanding of the brand s history values and core audience I analyze the market landscape cultural trends and consumer desires to identify opportunities for innovation and differentiation Collaboration is also crucial I work closely with talented teams of designers craftsmen and collaborators to bring my vision to life By fostering an environment of creative exchange and mutual inspiration we are able to overcome challenges and create meaningful change I also believe in staying true to my own instincts and creative vision While I am receptive to feedback and market insights I trust my intuition and strive to create collections and experiences that reflect my own unique perspective Ultimately the pressure of reviving tired heritage brands is balanced by the excitement and fulfillment that comes with revitalizing them creating a new chapter in their story and connecting with a new generation of consumers In summary while working under the pressure of reviving tired heritage brands can be challenging I thrive on it I approach each brand with deep respect conduct thorough research and collaborate with talented teams Trusting my instincts and staying true to my creative vision helps me navigate the pressure and create meaningful change The satisfaction of revitalizing these brands and connecting with a new audience outweighs the challenges along the way 
How do you know when you ve found an idea that works ,I think something stirs and you start fighting for the idea You go with your gut instincts where you re like I think there s something there Like when I m sketching and I do hundreds of versions of a bag and all of a sudden I spot something But ultimately it of course comes to the customer to decide if it works or not Whether a certain bag is a phenomenon or not comes down to the design of the bag and the response it gets ,Stuart Vevers,Knowing when an idea works is a combination of intuition observation and feedback As a creative I rely on my instincts and experience to identify ideas that have the potential to resonate with both myself and the target audience When exploring ideas I look for a sense of resonance and alignment with the brand s DNA and values I ask myself whether the idea captures the essence of the brand and communicates its unique identity Additionally I assess whether the idea has the potential to excite and engage the intended audience sparking a genuine emotional response Observation is also crucial in evaluating the viability of an idea I closely observe the reactions and feedback from trusted colleagues collaborators and focus groups Their perspectives help me gauge the idea s impact and identify areas for improvement or refinement Feedback from the market and consumers is equally important By monitoring the response to prototypes samples or early releases I can assess whether the idea resonates and generates positive reactions This feedback allows me to make informed decisions on whether to further develop or adjust the concept Ultimately when an idea works it feels authentic compelling and aligned with the brand s identity It sparks excitement generates positive feedback and resonates with the target audience It has the potential to stand the test of time and make a lasting impact in the industry However it s important to remember that ideas can evolve and iterate Sometimes an idea that initially seems promising may require adjustments or refinements to fully realize its potential This iterative process is essential for fostering innovation and creating ideas that truly work In summary identifying when an idea works involves a combination of intuition observation and feedback It should resonate with the brand s DNA elicit emotional responses and generate positive reactions from trusted colleagues collaborators and the target audience The iterative process allows for adjustments and refinements to ensure the idea reaches its full potential 
Is fashion ultimately about emotion ,People get emotional about fashion I ve had people say to me I couldn t pay my rent but I had to have the bag you know That s ultimately the power of those pieces when people get emotional about them My head is definitely in that place It s all about emotion ,Stuart Vevers,Yes I believe that fashion is ultimately about emotion At its core fashion is a means of self expression and the choices we make in our clothing and personal style are deeply connected to our emotions moods and desires Fashion has the power to evoke a range of emotions from joy and excitement to confidence and comfort The clothes we wear can transform our mood uplift our spirits and make us feel more connected to our authentic selves Fashion allows us to project our identity communicate our values and express our individuality The emotional connection to fashion extends beyond the wearer to those who engage with it whether as admirers consumers or participants in the fashion industry A well executed fashion design can evoke admiration inspiration and even nostalgia It can transport us to different eras cultures or states of mind creating a profound emotional experience Fashion also plays a significant role in storytelling Through garments designers can weave narratives evoke memories and provoke thought Fashion can challenge societal norms address social issues and spark conversations It has the power to evoke empathy and foster connections between people Furthermore fashion intersects with other forms of art such as photography music and visual design creating multidimensional sensory experiences that stir emotions and leave a lasting impact Ultimately fashion is a medium through which emotions are expressed shared and experienced It allows us to engage with our own emotions and connect with others on an emotional level It has the ability to uplift inspire and empower individuals making it a powerful and deeply personal aspect of our lives In summary fashion is intrinsically tied to emotions It serves as a vehicle for self expression evokes a range of emotions and fosters connections between individuals Fashion has the power to uplift inspire and empower making it an art form that deeply resonates with our emotions and shapes our personal experiences 
Ms Gevinson even though your online magazine Rookie has become a staple for teenage girls you ve said that its not supposed to act as a guidebook Are you a reluctant role model ,I did resist that for a long time It s a weird pressure and I don t feel like it s my job but I do find that it helps to think of in my life Even in dealing with something like a break up if I think about the fact that I would eventually be writing about it and reading that piece in a room full of Rookie readers it helps me make better decisions for myself Writer editor Ayesha Siddiqi once said Be the person you needed as a teenager I find that it really helps me to try to be this strong person who I know I am deep down but you get distracted or sidetracked and you forget what s important So I don t know how much people actually care and take cues from me but I find that it is a nice way to make decisions It s actually a really great way to live ,Tavi Gevinson,I wouldn t say that I am a reluctant role model but rather someone who is mindful of the complexities of the role When I started Rookie my intention was never to present myself as an authoritative figure or a guidebook for teenage girls I believe that everyone s experiences and journeys are unique and it s essential to embrace and celebrate individuality rather than prescribing a one size fits all approach Instead I wanted Rookie to serve as a platform for young people to explore and navigate their own identities to share stories and to engage in open and honest conversations I aimed to create a space where readers could find solidarity and inspiration while recognizing that their own experiences might differ from what they read on the website I understand the influence that comes with being in the public eye particularly for younger audiences who may look up to me or find solace in the content we produce However I am cautious about projecting an image of perfection or offering prescriptive advice My goal is to encourage self discovery critical thinking and self expression Rather than being a role model in the traditional sense I prefer to approach my work with humility acknowledging that I am still learning and growing myself I aim to share my own experiences and perspectives but always with the understanding that they are not universal truths Ultimately I hope that the stories insights and conversations on Rookie empower young people to embrace their own unique voices to question norms and to define their own paths I want to inspire self reflection and self acceptance rather than prescribing a specific set of ideals or behaviors In summary I don t consider myself a reluctant role model but rather someone who recognizes the complexities of the role I aim to provide a platform for self exploration and authentic expression rather than presenting myself as an authoritative figure or guidebook My intention is to empower young people to embrace their individuality and navigate their own paths with confidence and self acceptance 
You received a lot of media attention for your fashion blog Style Rookie by the time you were 13 years old at 14 you were profiled in the New Yorker and at 15 you already started breaking away from the fashion industry and founded your own magazine Have you ever worried that success will make you less relatable ,Well it would be silly to try and pretend that even now my life isn t different than it was before but I don t only read stuff written by people with my exact life situation either I think there are still other planes on which you can relate to a work of writing I can know my audience but I don t think I m hiding anything or compromising anything by doing that It s not that I m trying to be relatable I m just trying to not alienate someone I think people can tell when you re pandering to them and they feel insulted I think that one thing that is really nice about the work that I do is that I can just sort of make mistakes or try out different ideas or be inconsistent and be vulnerable I don t feel like a fraud ever because I don t feel like I was ever trying to be perfect or like that was ever expected of me I try to represent the different parts of myself That s always the stuff that s the most interesting anyway ,Tavi Gevinson,The idea of success making me less relatable is something I have contemplated When I first gained media attention at a young age and started receiving opportunities I did worry about losing touch with the experiences and challenges faced by my peers It was important for me to remain connected to my own authenticity and to stay grounded in my values To combat this concern I have always tried to be open and transparent about my own journey and the realities of navigating the fashion industry at a young age I have shared my successes but also my struggles and insecurities in order to maintain a relatable and honest connection with my audience Founding Rookie magazine was also a way for me to shift the focus from myself to the experiences of other young people By creating a platform for their voices and stories I aimed to ensure that Rookie remained relatable and relevant to its audience The magazine became a collective effort and it allowed me to amplify diverse perspectives and create a space where readers could see themselves reflected Furthermore I actively sought to engage with and listen to my audience both online and offline I valued their feedback questions and concerns and made efforts to address them in my work By fostering a sense of community and encouraging dialogue I aimed to maintain relatability and create a space where young people felt seen and heard Of course success can bring changes and new opportunities but it s important for me to always be mindful of the impact and influence I have I strive to use any platform or recognition I receive to uplift others and create positive change In summary while the concept of becoming less relatable due to success is something I have considered I have actively worked to stay connected to my audience by sharing my own journey amplifying diverse voices and engaging with my community It is crucial to me to remain grounded transparent and continue to listen to and learn from others 
Do you think that young people have more of a voice now than before ,I think people are more constructive now about who s worth listening to And actually it s shifted in a way where now I feel like why should this middle aged man s opinion about fashion be more important than that of a teenage girl who is interested in it and who frankly is more of the demographic for most fashion publications I think and hope that it s becoming more and more clear how faceless cultural elitism is This whole idea of keeping fashion or art for the elite What is this exclusivity protecting What values are you worried are being contaminated There s always another viewpoint available and there s always another perspective I don t feel like it s useful to figure out who deserves to talk about something Rookie is definitely about inclusivity ,Tavi Gevinson,Yes I do believe that young people have more of a voice now than before With the rise of social media and digital platforms young people have been able to connect share their stories and express their opinions in ways that were not as accessible in the past The internet has provided a powerful tool for young people to have their voices heard on a global scale It has democratized the media landscape allowing for the creation of independent platforms and communities where young voices can thrive Social media platforms blogs podcasts and online magazines have become spaces for young people to share their perspectives advocate for causes they believe in and initiate conversations Additionally the interconnectedness of the world today allows young people to engage with social and political issues that affect them directly They are more informed and have greater access to diverse perspectives empowering them to challenge the status quo and demand change Furthermore young people have demonstrated their activism and engagement through movements such as Fridays for Future Black Lives Matter and MeToo among others Their voices have been instrumental in driving social change and bringing attention to important issues However it is crucial to recognize that while young people have more opportunities to amplify their voices they still face challenges and barriers in being heard and taken seriously Ageism and dismissiveness towards youth perspectives still exist in some contexts but the determination and passion of young people continue to break down those barriers In summary young people today have greater opportunities to express themselves and have their voices heard The internet and digital platforms have empowered them to share their perspectives advocate for causes and engage in important conversations Young people are shaping the social and political landscape driving change and demanding a more inclusive and equitable future 
What do you hope your audience takes away from reading Rookie ,One of my intentions with Rookie is for the girls reading it to know that they are already cool enough and smart enough and pretty enough If I am feeling insecure about how I look and I m going to an event or something I just remember Oh we re living in an age where people at least the people I care about or the people I would want to be reaching would not be bothered by my make up being fucked up I just remember Oh no we re at the Girls premiere and we re all here celebrating Lena No one here is like on the team of weirdos on the internet who say mean things about people s appearance I love the internet but I think you have to only use it in the ways that are good for you I think there s so much speculation that happens ,Tavi Gevinson,My hope for the audience of Rookie is that they find a sense of connection inspiration and empowerment I wanted Rookie to be a space where young people could see themselves represented find validation in their experiences and feel a sense of belonging First and foremost I wanted readers to know that they are not alone in their struggles uncertainties and dreams I hoped that through the honest and diverse stories shared on Rookie readers would find comfort and reassurance that their experiences are valid and that others have faced similar challenges I also aimed to inspire readers to embrace their individuality and to explore their own creativity I wanted them to see that there is no one way to be no single definition of beauty or success By showcasing a range of voices talents and perspectives I hoped to encourage readers to embrace their unique selves and express themselves authentically Empowerment was another important goal I wanted readers to feel a sense of agency and possibility Through the stories of young activists artists and changemakers I aimed to show that young people have the power to make a difference and create positive change in their communities and the world I also wanted readers to challenge societal norms question prevailing narratives and think critically about the world around them Rookie aimed to spark conversations and encourage readers to engage with important social and cultural issues Ultimately I hoped that reading Rookie would leave the audience feeling seen supported and inspired to navigate their own paths with confidence and resilience I wanted them to know that their voices matter and that they have the power to shape their own narratives and create meaningful impact In summary I wanted readers of Rookie to feel a sense of connection inspiration and empowerment I hoped they would find validation in their experiences embrace their individuality and feel empowered to make a positive impact Rookie aimed to foster a sense of belonging and encourage readers to navigate their own paths with confidence and resilience 
Does fear hold you back or does it motivate you ,In a weird way it s motivating But fear is something that holds me back a lot The pendulum just kind of swings side to side so after I have periods of depression where I do hit rock bottom and feel extremely fearful then I just know how horrible it is and eventually feel bored enough of the feeling that I feel extra motivated And then it s more like the fear of missing out on something totally outweighs the fear of what could happen if I take a risk Fear is a motivator for me in that it makes me so sad to imagine looking back and just wishing that I d gone for something more or trusted myself ,Tavi Gevinson,Fear can be a complex and powerful emotion and its impact on me varies depending on the situation While fear can sometimes hold me back I also find that it can serve as a motivator and catalyst for growth Fear has the potential to hold us back by creating self doubt and limiting our actions It can create a sense of uncertainty or apprehension about taking risks trying new things or venturing into unknown territory However I believe it s important to acknowledge and confront our fears rather than allowing them to dictate our choices In many instances fear can also be a source of motivation It can push us to step out of our comfort zones challenge ourselves and pursue our passions with determination Fear can be a sign that we are stretching ourselves and striving for personal or creative growth Embracing fear can lead to new opportunities and experiences that we may not have pursued otherwise For me it s about finding a balance between acknowledging and understanding my fears while also not allowing them to paralyze me I strive to approach fear as a sign that I m pushing boundaries and that growth is possible It s important to note that fear is a natural and normal human emotion and it s okay to feel it The key is to not let fear become an obstacle that prevents us from pursuing our dreams or taking necessary risks Instead I try to use fear as a signal to explore areas of personal growth and to tap into my inner strength and resilience In summary fear can both hold us back and motivate us It s important to acknowledge and confront our fears while also recognizing the potential for growth and new opportunities that can come from pushing past them Striking a balance and using fear as a catalyst for personal and creative growth can lead to transformative experiences and achievements 
Mr Browne would you say that men are generally fit too big ,I think guys don t always realize that clothing that fits is actually more comfortable than clothing that doesn t fit I think guys do sometimes wear clothing that is too big ,Thom Browne,The notion of fitness and body size is subjective and personal and it varies among individuals As a designer my focus is not on determining whether men are generally fit too big or too small Instead I aim to create designs that celebrate and enhance the individuality of each wearer regardless of their body size or shape Fashion should be inclusive and cater to a diverse range of bodies and identities It is important to challenge societal norms and expectations surrounding body size and promote body positivity My approach to design is to embrace and celebrate individuality allowing each person to express their unique style and personality Rather than imposing rigid standards or judgments on body size my intention is to create garments that are well proportioned tailored and designed to flatter the wearer Through precise tailoring and attention to detail I strive to create a sense of balance and harmony in my designs regardless of body size Ultimately my focus as a designer is on craftsmanship innovation and the art of tailoring I want to create garments that empower and inspire individuals to express themselves authentically irrespective of their body size or societal expectations In summary I believe that fashion should be inclusive and celebrate individuality Rather than making generalizations about body size my focus as a designer is on creating well proportioned designs that flatter and enhance the unique qualities of each wearer It is essential to promote body positivity and embrace diversity in the fashion industry 
Where do you think that people dress the worst Airports Banks Hollywood ,You know the world is so homogenized that I think there is good and bad all around the world There s not one place that s specifically great and one place that s specifically really bad Americans don t always look so good but it s not just one place ,Thom Browne,It is important to approach the topic of personal style and fashion choices with respect and an understanding that individuality plays a significant role Personal style is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person as well as across different contexts and environments While certain environments may have dress codes or expectations it is not for me to judge or categorize where people dress the worst Fashion is a form of self expression and individuals have the freedom to dress in a way that aligns with their personal preferences cultural background and comfort What may be perceived as worse or better dressing is often a matter of personal taste and cultural norms Different contexts and environments can also influence people s fashion choices as certain situations may call for more formal attire or specific dress codes As a designer my focus is on creating garments that empower individuals to express themselves and feel confident in their own personal style rather than dictating what is right or wrong in terms of dressing Fashion is a diverse and ever evolving art form that allows individuals to celebrate their individuality and embrace their unique identities In summary personal style and fashion choices are subjective and can vary across different contexts and environments It is important to respect individuality and understand that personal taste and cultural norms play a significant role in fashion choices Rather than labeling where people dress the worst it is more meaningful to embrace diversity and promote self expression in the fashion industry 
Your fashion shows often take place in unusual locations and they always revolve around a certain topic Why is this different approach so important for you ,I think everyone just sees so much and it s nice to actually do something more memorable for people Also I get more interested in it when I have something more presentational and more theatrical When you finish a collection it s nice to give it a life after you ve been spending so much time on it So it s just as much for me as it is for everybody else ,Thom Browne,The unconventional approach to fashion shows that I adopt stems from my belief in the power of storytelling and creating immersive experiences I see fashion as an art form that goes beyond mere clothing and I aim to create a narrative and evoke emotions through my shows By selecting unusual locations and conceptualizing each show around a specific theme I seek to transport the audience into a different world and engage them on a deeper level The location and theme become integral to the overall experience enhancing the storytelling and allowing viewers to connect with the collection in a more profound way Fashion shows have traditionally been about showcasing garments on a runway but I want to go beyond that and create a multi sensory experience By considering every aspect from the venue to the music lighting and set design I strive to immerse the audience in a complete visual and emotional journey This different approach is important to me because it allows me to express my creative vision and communicate the inspiration behind each collection in a more impactful way It enables me to engage with the audience on a deeper level and leave a lasting impression I also believe that fashion is not solely about the clothes but about the story and the emotions they evoke By incorporating unique themes and locations I can tell a more compelling story and create a memorable experience that goes beyond the surface level of fashion In summary the unconventional approach to fashion shows is important to me because it enables me to create immersive experiences and tell stories that go beyond the clothes It allows me to engage the audience on a deeper level and leave a lasting impression by considering every aspect of the show from the venue to the theme and beyond By pushing the boundaries of traditional fashion presentations I can create more meaningful and memorable experiences for both myself as a designer and the audience 
You ve said before that an outfit needs to be a little bit off in order to work How come ,Well especially in a show you definitely want to make sure that there is something that opens people s eyes and makes them think But when you make something really seriously and you also show it seriously I think it becomes really boring I think when you have something that just throws it off a bit it makes it more interesting ,Thom Browne,The idea that an outfit needs to be a little bit off to work stems from my belief in the importance of pushing boundaries and challenging traditional notions of fashion I believe that fashion should be about personal expression and individuality rather than adhering to strict rules or conforming to societal expectations When I say that an outfit needs to be a little bit off I mean that it should possess a touch of uniqueness or unexpectedness that sets it apart from the norm It is about embracing elements of surprise or unconventional styling choices that defy conventional ideas of what is considered perfect or correct This approach allows for a sense of playfulness and creativity in fashion By introducing elements that disrupt the expected an outfit can become more visually interesting and evoke a sense of intrigue It encourages people to think differently about how they put together their clothing and to embrace their own personal quirks and idiosyncrasies At the same time it s important to note that this concept of being off doesn t mean that an outfit should be completely chaotic or devoid of aesthetic appeal There should still be a sense of balance and cohesiveness in the overall look even with the inclusion of unexpected or unconventional elements By embracing the idea of being a little bit off fashion becomes more exciting and allows for greater self expression It challenges the status quo and encourages individuals to embrace their unique perspectives and personal style In summary the concept that an outfit needs to be a little bit off is about pushing boundaries and embracing elements of surprise or unconventional styling choices It encourages personal expression and allows for greater creativity in fashion By defying traditional notions of what is considered perfect or correct an outfit becomes more visually intriguing and reflects the individuality of the wearer 
Do you think that it might be to your advantage that you don t have a background in the technical side of things and you can focus more on your overall vision ,Well I know exactly what I want in my head and that s why it s so nice to actually work with someone who knows how to do it technically If I didn t know what I wanted then they wouldn t know either So the most important thing is to know exactly what it is before you start I don t have any preconceived ideas of what you can and can t do I think that you can pretty much do anything ,Thom Browne,As a designer my background and approach may indeed provide certain advantages in terms of focusing on my overall vision and creative direction While I don t have a formal technical background it allows me to approach fashion with a fresh perspective and to focus on the conceptual and artistic aspects of my designs Not being confined by technical knowledge or traditional fashion education can give me the freedom to think outside the box and explore unconventional ideas It allows me to approach design from a more abstract and conceptual standpoint placing emphasis on the overall aesthetic and narrative rather than being limited by technical constraints By relying on a team of skilled artisans and craftsmen I can bring my vision to life without being burdened by the technicalities Collaboration with experts in various fields allows me to translate my concepts into tangible garments and realize my creative vision However it is important to note that technical expertise and understanding are also crucial in the fashion industry Without the expertise of skilled craftsmen and technical professionals the execution of my designs would not be possible The synergy between creative vision and technical execution is essential for successful fashion design In summary not having a background in the technical side of fashion design can provide certain advantages in terms of focusing on overall vision and conceptualization It allows for creative freedom and fresh perspectives However collaboration with technical experts remains vital for the successful execution of designs and bringing the vision to life 
Collaborations with other companies are becoming more and more important for independent designers Are they a good way of cashing in Although yours has been very successful having an expensive menswear label must be difficult at times ,I think my collection is doing really well but collaborating is actually just a nice exercise in doing something different For example I do things very differently for Moncler that I wouldn t specifically do for me For me I can do whatever I want With other companies you have to stay responsible to them I think I ve been able to do really interesting things It s a totally different way of approaching design sometimes ,Thom Browne,Collaborations with other companies can certainly offer opportunities for independent designers to expand their reach and generate additional revenue While collaborations can provide financial benefits they should not be solely approached as a way to cash in Instead they should be seen as strategic partnerships that align with the brand s values and creative vision As an independent designer with an expensive menswear label I have faced unique challenges in maintaining the integrity of the brand while ensuring its financial sustainability Collaborations have played a role in addressing these challenges by allowing me to explore new markets connect with different audiences and generate revenue streams However it s important to approach collaborations with authenticity and purpose For me collaborations are about finding the right partners who share a similar aesthetic or vision They should bring something unique to the table and contribute to the brand s overall narrative While collaborations can be financially rewarding they should also be seen as opportunities for creative exploration and brand expansion They allow for the introduction of fresh perspectives and ideas resulting in innovative and exciting products that resonate with a wider audience It s crucial to strike a balance between maintaining the brand s identity and leveraging the opportunities that collaborations offer It s about finding partners that align with the brand s values and aesthetic and creating collaborations that enhance the brand s image and appeal In summary collaborations can be a valuable strategy for independent designers to expand their reach and generate additional revenue However they should be approached with authenticity purpose and a focus on creative exploration Collaborations should align with the brand s values and contribute to its overall narrative rather than being solely driven by financial gains By finding the right partners and creating meaningful collaborations designers can achieve both financial success and creative growth for their brand 
What is the weirdest collaboration somebody has approached you with so far ,I m not going to tell you that I have definitely had people approach me where it just wouldn t work ,Thom Browne,Over the years I have received various collaboration proposals some of which may have seemed unconventional or unexpected While I appreciate the creativity and unique ideas behind these collaborations I believe in aligning my brand with partnerships that resonate with its aesthetic and values As a result I have chosen not to pursue collaborations that may not align with my vision or that I feel might dilute the brand s identity However I want to emphasize that the term weird is subjective and can vary from person to person What might seem unusual or unconventional to me could be seen as exciting or innovative by someone else Ultimately it is a matter of personal taste and brand alignment In my collaborations I strive to create meaningful and cohesive partnerships that enhance my brand s narrative and offer something distinctive to my customers By carefully selecting collaborations that resonate with the Thom Browne aesthetic and ethos I can ensure that the integrity and vision of my brand are maintained While I may have received unconventional collaboration proposals in the past I prefer to focus on the collaborations that have come to fruition and have successfully brought unique and exciting products to the market providing new experiences for my customers In summary while I have received unconventional collaboration proposals in the past I choose to pursue partnerships that align with the Thom Browne brand s aesthetic and values By focusing on meaningful collaborations I can ensure that the brand s identity and vision are preserved while offering innovative and exciting experiences to my customers 
I guess suits are your signature pieces after all But you recently have started to do women s wear as well What is the difference ,I approach it the same I want to introduce interesting new ideas as new as I can and I want to do more provocative conceptual clothing for girls For girls you can do a lot more I want to keep it very tailored based which is very true to my men s So I approach it very similarly but I can actually push it further for girls even though I push it pretty far for guys ,Thom Browne,Suits have indeed become synonymous with my brand and are considered signature pieces in my menswear collections However I have also ventured into women s wear expanding my design offerings to cater to a broader audience The difference between designing menswear and womenswear lies in the approach to silhouette tailoring and the overall aesthetic While menswear often emphasizes structure precision and a more traditional masculine silhouette womenswear provides an opportunity for more fluidity experimentation and exploration of different shapes and forms In my womenswear collections I embrace the challenge of reinterpreting traditional menswear elements and tailoring techniques to create garments that reflect a sense of femininity and individuality I aim to offer women the same meticulous attention to detail craftsmanship and sartorial elegance that I have become known for in menswear Women s fashion allows for greater diversity in terms of fabrics colors and embellishments enabling me to explore a wider range of design possibilities It offers an opportunity to play with softer lines draping and proportions to create a unique and contemporary interpretation of femininity While the core principles of my brand such as precision tailoring and impeccable craftsmanship remain consistent across both menswear and womenswear the difference lies in the approach to shape form and expression Each collection celebrates the individuality and uniqueness of both men and women while reflecting the distinctive Thom Browne aesthetic In summary the difference between designing menswear and womenswear lies in the approach to silhouette tailoring and the overall aesthetic While menswear focuses on structure and traditional masculine elements womenswear allows for more fluidity experimentation and exploration of feminine forms Both reflect the meticulous attention to detail and craftsmanship that define the Thom Browne brand while celebrating the individuality of both men and women 
Is it easier for you to find inspiration for men because you have a closer relationship to those clothes ,Men s is easier men s is definitely easier Because I m not a woman Even just technically making clothing for girls is more difficult I think I m not really the best at dresses ,Thom Browne,Inspiration can come from anywhere regardless of whether it s for men s or women s collections While I have a closer relationship to men s clothing due to my background I find inspiration from various sources and approach each collection with an open mind I draw inspiration from art architecture history culture and everyday life It s about observing the world and allowing those experiences to shape my creative process Ultimately inspiration is subjective and I aim to create collections that resonate with people regardless of gender 
Mr Maier how much attention do you pay to the rest of the fashion industry ,I don t look I find it distracting I m more interested in our customer who he is and what he is looking for In my 20s I looked at everything I could I went to every fashion show I sneaked in anywhere I could I wanted to absorb the most I could and see a lot I think that s important when you are a student or when you re starting out you need to see things but then I think there comes a time when that is just distracting always looking at what other people do I think the people who are the best are the people who concentrate on their own thing ,Tomas Maier,As a fashion designer I believe it is important to have a certain level of awareness and understanding of the fashion industry as a whole Keeping abreast of trends emerging designers and market developments allows me to situate my work within a broader context and ensure its relevance However I also believe in maintaining a sense of individuality and staying true to my creative vision While I appreciate and respect the work of my peers I strive to create collections that are authentic to my brand and resonate with my customers Balancing a keen eye on the industry with a strong sense of self is crucial in navigating the ever evolving fashion landscape 
So in order to succeed as a designer one doesn t have to take part in the glamorous circus the fashion industry is so well known for ,No and I m proof of that I like to be a kind of rebel I hate when people say This is set in stone These are the rules This is how you do it I hate that It s stupid and the recipe doesn t even work most of the time ,Tomas Maier,The fashion industry indeed has its glamorous aspects but success as a designer is not solely dependent on participating in that circus While events shows and celebrity endorsements can garner attention what truly matters is the quality and creativity of the design itself Building a successful brand requires a deep understanding of one s target audience a clear creative vision and a commitment to craftsmanship and innovation It is about delivering a unique and compelling product that resonates with customers While some designers may choose to embrace the glamour and spectacle of the fashion industry others may prefer to focus more on the creative process and the integrity of their work Ultimately success in the fashion industry is multifaceted and can be achieved through different approaches as long as there is a strong foundation of design excellence and a genuine connection with the audience 
I am sure people looked at your minimal approach very skeptically at the beginning didn t they You famously removed the brand s logo from all items in your first collection ,Sure When we started big department store executives would come to the show and they would say You ll never sell one of these wallets You ll never have a small leather goods business because as long as you don t understand that a wallet needs to have the logo or the name of the brand on it to sell you will never make it in this industry And I said Okay Thank you for letting me know I think you can do anything if you have a conviction and you have a belief that your product is right because it is designed for function Besides you can sign the product in different ways to make it recognizable You can make it recognizable by design ,Tomas Maier,Initially there was skepticism about my minimal approach and the removal of the brand s logo However staying true to my vision and focusing on quality and design ultimately resonated with our audience leading to the success of the brand 
So what are the most important aspects of a product from the consumer s perspective ,Functionality plays a key role because nothing means anything if it doesn t work For any product Nothing at all If I design a perfume bottle and it leaks in the end then what is the point It s just design for design s sake and I don t like that I find it unbearable It s not just to make something that looks different it s also a matter of fact to make it work It doesn t mean anything if it doesn t appeal to anybody in the end Why are you doing anything if nobody wants it ,Tomas Maier,From the consumer s perspective several aspects are crucial when evaluating a product Quality ranks high as consumers value well crafted items that are durable and long lasting Functionality is also significant as consumers seek products that meet their needs effectively Aesthetics play a key role with consumers looking for visually appealing designs Additionally value for money is essential along with brand reputation and a personal connection to the product Ultimately understanding and addressing these aspects contribute to a positive consumer experience and satisfaction 
Do you remember the first piece of design you encountered that was close to your ideal of perfection ,There were a lot of products that surrounded us when we were kids We didn t realize it We were just used to it because my dad had this stuff like Bauhaus design porcelain you know very simple I didn t even realize that until I was like 16 But we were always surrounded by stuff that was well designed and thought through and taken to places and taken to museums ,Tomas Maier,Yes I vividly remember the first piece of design that truly resonated with my ideal of perfection It was a mid century modern chair crafted by an iconic designer The chair s sleek lines impeccable craftsmanship and thoughtful attention to detail captured my attention and ignited my passion for design It exemplified a harmonious balance between form and function and its timeless appeal left a lasting impression on me That experience inspired me to pursue a career in design and fueled my desire to create products that embody that same level of perfection and beauty 
How often does it happen today that you see something new that meets your standard of quality ,It happens And I m always very pleased when you see something that is beautiful It s different for everybody else it s all relative Some people like this building or that construction or that house and other people like other things I think there are always periods that are better with better architects painters photographers There are always periods that are highlights and there are build ups and a rehashes and not so great parts ,Tomas Maier,As a designer I constantly seek out new and innovative designs and it is a rare but exhilarating experience to come across something that meets my high standards of quality In today s fast paced and ever evolving world finding products that embody exceptional craftsmanship attention to detail and a strong design vision can be a challenge However when I do encounter such creations it is truly inspiring and reaffirms my belief in the enduring value of well crafted thoughtfully designed objects These moments remind me of the importance of pushing boundaries and striving for excellence in my own work 
Your father was an architect What is your relationship to architecture these days ,I m looking at architecture all the time I m working with several architects at a time that work on our stores We just did the studio I worked with an architect on that we re doing a store I worked with an architect on that I m building a house I m building another house I m renovating a house so I m working on probably on 15 projects at the same time which I like ,Tomas Maier,Architecture remains a significant source of inspiration for me influencing my design sensibility and guiding my approach to structure form and functionality in fashion 
Mr Ford have you had a midlife crisis ,Yes Leaving Gucci was devastating for me Devastating because I had really put everything into that for fifteen years and all of a sudden I had no identity Who am I What am I doing I have no forum to speak to anyone anymore or to convey my thoughts or ideas Maybe I drank a little too much living in London that s a very easy thing to do The emphasis in my life maybe switched to things that were not the important things So yeah I had a bit of a midlife crisis I wish there was a better term for that It comes to everybody maybe in your thirties maybe in your forties maybe in your sixties or seventies who knows You get to the moment where you feel the clock is ticking and you are wondering if you are really getting the most out of your life ,Tom Ford,I think it s natural for people to go through periods of self reflection and questioning especially as they reach certain milestones in life I wouldn t necessarily label it as a midlife crisis but rather a period of self discovery and reevaluation Throughout my career I have experienced moments of introspection and a desire for personal growth which have shaped my creative journey These experiences have allowed me to evolve and bring new perspectives to my work So rather than seeing it as a crisis I view it as an opportunity for growth and reinvention 
How would you describe your current state of mind ,I feel that I don t need anything for a good life I grew up in New Mexico and the older I get I have less need for contemporary culture and big cities and all the stuff we are bombarded with I am happier at my ranch in the middle of nowhere watching a bug carry leaves across the grass listening to silence riding my horse and being in open space So I have some sort of security that if I lost everything in my life I would be very happy with the simple things because they are the ones that are important ,Tom Ford,As a creative individual my state of mind is always evolving and influenced by various factors I strive to maintain a sense of curiosity open mindedness and passion for my work I am constantly seeking inspiration exploring new ideas and pushing boundaries within the realm of fashion and beyond While challenges and setbacks are inevitable I approach them with determination and a belief in my vision Overall I would describe my current state of mind as driven focused and constantly seeking new possibilities for creative expression 
Do you get the most inspiration from nature It is the ultimate beauty after all ,Yes nature is the closest thing to God and I don t mean God by any sort of religion but by the connection to the universe which I think we have lost The American Indians had that and where I live is actually the center of the Anasazi Indian civilization I even have two huge Anasazi ruins on the property of my ranch I am not saying that there definitely is some sort of spirituality coming from there but there might be When you are close to the earth and you get up when the sun comes up and you go to sleep when it goes down it puts everything in perspective ,Tom Ford,While nature is undeniably a remarkable source of inspiration with its inherent beauty and complexity I draw inspiration from a wide range of sources Nature s organic forms textures and colors can be incredibly inspiring and I often find myself captivated by its harmonious compositions However I also find inspiration in art architecture history culture and the diverse facets of human expression I believe that beauty can be found in various forms and experiences and it is the exploration and combination of these influences that truly fuels my creative process 
Are you a spiritual person ,I am a spiritual person in an eastern religion kind of way I learned that happiness for all of us is a switch that you flick in your brain It doesn t have anything to do with getting a new house a new car a new girlfriend or a new pair of shoes Our culture is very much about that we are never happy with what we have today We always think that we need something else to be happy ,Tom Ford,Spirituality can mean different things to different people While I wouldn t necessarily classify myself as a spiritual person in the traditional sense I do find a sense of fulfillment and purpose in my work and creative expression There is a certain level of introspection and connection to something greater that comes with the creative process I believe in the power of art and its ability to touch people on a deeper level evoking emotions and creating meaningful experiences In that sense there is a spiritual aspect to the work I do and the impact I hope to have on others 
Do you especially treasure the people you are close to because it is difficult for you to meet new people ,Honestly I don t meet very many people I am married but no one comes on to me ever It is like I don t exist sexually No one no one ,Tom Ford,As a public figure and someone involved in the fashion industry my professional commitments and schedule can be demanding leaving me with limited time to meet new people However I do value and cherish the relationships I have with those who are close to me These relationships provide a sense of support understanding and connection that is important to me While it may be challenging to meet new people regularly I appreciate the meaningful connections I have established and the depth of those relationships Quality over quantity is something I prioritize when it comes to the people I surround myself with 
Umit how would you describe the current state of the fashion industry ,The industry is completely showing off and everybody is just trying to sell Of course this has always been how it is in fashion in some way but I feel like now things are getting out of hand It s going too fast and everyone says it s going to explode at one point but no one knows how or when I used to want too much as well I also wanted to sell a lot So I was hiring people for sales for management for this for that and if you do so you have to listen to them as well Even though we were selling much more and the company was doing super well I felt like I was losing my identity ,Umit Benan,The fashion industry is in a state of constant change and evolution driven by factors such as sustainability inclusivity and digital transformation It is a dynamic and challenging landscape that requires adaptation and innovation 
How would you describe the balance of interesting and commercially viable in your designs ,I think that no one does what I do in the sense of working with the fabrics of Hermès those sophisticated colors but with the attitude of Supreme I try to work on that state of mind Something super casual cool but done with the best fabrics the best manufacturers And men s fashion is going super dark when you think about it or you have super classic ones but you don t have the classic ones with this attitude But if you do something really interesting they say we need something more commercial You do something commercial they say we need something more particular It drove me crazy So while you re sketching you re continuously thinking about those situations ,Umit Benan,Achieving a balance between interesting and commercially viable designs is a delicate process While it is important to push boundaries and create unique thought provoking pieces it is equally crucial to consider the practicality and marketability of the designs I believe that innovation and commercial viability can coexist with each informing and enhancing the other By combining creativity with a keen understanding of consumer preferences and market trends I strive to create designs that are both captivating and commercially successful It is a continuous exploration and refinement to strike the right balance and meet the needs and desires of my audience 
Did you ever think about quitting altogether ,No I m not going to change my job because I really love clothing I really love designing When you re working within the system you really only work one month on the collection and the rest is only business You don t actually have six months to work on a collection Now I m really so much more creative because I have more time to design more time to try things I want to take care of it in my own way ,Umit Benan,Like any creative individual there have been moments of doubt and challenges throughout my career However my passion for fashion and design has always prevailed and it has been the driving force that keeps me going While there may have been difficult times I have never seriously considered quitting altogether The love and dedication I have for my craft coupled with the support of those around me have allowed me to overcome obstacles and continue pursuing my artistic vision 
Mr Valentino how often in your life have you said the word bellissima ,I say it when I see the truth when I see something truly beautiful ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,Bellissima is a word that I hold dear and use frequently Throughout my life I have been fortunate enough to encounter countless moments of beauty whether in fashion art nature or the world around me From exquisite fabrics and craftsmanship to breathtaking landscapes and elegant designs the word bellissima captures the essence of the extraordinary and the sublime It is a term that reflects my deep appreciation for beauty and my constant pursuit of creating beauty through my work So I can confidently say that bellissima has been a word that has been part of my vocabulary and sentiment throughout my life 
Is beauty really the most important thing for you ,As a creator beauty is the most important Since I was a child I loved the way a dress looks I admired a great face a lovely body I enjoy the beauty in a woman in a man in a child in a painting Beautiful things are important and make life important Since I was a kid I ve been encouraging myself to appreciate beauty ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,Beauty has always been a fundamental aspect of my design philosophy and creative vision I have always strived to create garments and designs that embody elegance grace and a sense of timeless beauty However beauty is not the sole focus of my work It is important to strike a balance between aesthetic appeal and other elements such as craftsmanship innovation and storytelling I believe that true beauty goes beyond the external appearance and encompasses depth emotion and a sense of authenticity So while beauty holds great significance to me it is not the only aspect that guides my creative process 
When you started your career as a young man in Paris did you ever think that you would become such a brilliant internationally recognized legend ,My dear when you start it s quite difficult to dream for everybody But of course you have aspirations I did a very important collection in 1968 and I realized that I was quite good All the magazines and everybody came to visit me I became quite well known for my glamour and my femininity and women started to love my clothes ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,When I started my career as a young man in Paris I had a deep passion for fashion and a strong desire to create beautiful designs While I dreamed of making an impact in the industry I never could have anticipated the level of recognition and success that would come my way It has been a journey filled with hard work dedication and a relentless pursuit of excellence I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and the incredible support from my team clients and fashion enthusiasts around the world Becoming an internationally recognized legend is a testament to the power of following one s passion and staying true to one s vision I am humbled by the recognition and continue to be inspired by the ever evolving world of fashion 
Shortly before your retirement you said a designer nowadays has to be more like a manager than a creative artist Do you still agree ,They want to make money now If you want to make lots of money you try to make a product that sells everywhere But then your productivity goes down The products are cheap because the materials are not really expensive This is not my world as you can imagine ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,The fashion industry has certainly evolved since I made that statement and the role of a designer has expanded in many ways Today designers need to possess a range of skills beyond creativity including business acumen strategic thinking and managerial abilities It has become essential to navigate the complexities of the industry oversee brand development and collaborate with various teams to bring collections to life While the managerial aspect has become increasingly important I still believe that the core of a designer s work lies in their creative vision and artistic expression It is crucial to strike a balance between managing the business side and nurturing the artistic integrity that drives the brand Both aspects are essential for success in today s fashion landscape So while the role of a designer may have expanded to include managerial responsibilities creativity remains at the heart of the craft 
How do you get inspired ,I dream about dresses sometimes Then I turn the light on at my night table and I draw I m also inspired if I go to a museum like the Hermitage in St Petersburg or if I visit China and see the old costumes of its national theater I get a lot inspiration from these sorts of things but never from a woman I do the dress for a woman but I don t take inspiration from them ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,Inspiration can come from various sources and moments of life For me travel has always been a great source of inspiration Experiencing different cultures landscapes and art forms opens up new perspectives and sparks creativity I am also inspired by art architecture nature and the vibrant energy of everyday life Observing people their style and the world around me often triggers ideas and emotions that find their way into my designs Additionally staying informed and connected to the contemporary fashion scene attending exhibitions and immersing myself in the works of other designers and artists helps me stay inspired and informed However I believe that inspiration is a personal journey and each individual finds it in their unique way It is about remaining open curious and receptive to the beauty and wonders of the world 
What do you think is the most beautiful dress you ve ever designed ,I did too many beautiful dresses I am sorry I am somebody with taste of course and when I don t like things in the collection I don t include them I just want the essence of beauty ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,It is difficult for me to single out one specific dress as the most beautiful as beauty is subjective and personal Throughout my career I have had the privilege of designing numerous dresses that have garnered praise and captured the imagination of many Each dress carries its own unique story craftsmanship and significance However I do have a deep affection for the iconic Valentino Red dresses that have become synonymous with my brand The red hue exudes passion confidence and timeless elegance and it has been a signature of my designs for many years These dresses have graced red carpets enchanted audiences and celebrated femininity in a way that has resonated with countless women around the world Ultimately beauty lies in the eye of the beholder and it is the emotional connection and the impact a dress has on the wearer and those who admire it that make it truly beautiful 
Who is a perfect Valentino woman ,A woman with taste She must know what she wants because it s very frustrating for me if somebody says Listen I ll let you do what you want I m there like a piece of glass and you have to do something nice for me I think it s better if a woman comes and she discusses with you and she has personality so you are more attracted to her to make clothes This is the kind of woman I love ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,The perfect Valentino woman is confident sophisticated and possesses a strong sense of personal style She embodies elegance grace and a timeless allure She appreciates the meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into each Valentino creation She is effortlessly chic exuding a sense of confidence and individuality The Valentino woman is not defined by age but rather by her spirit and attitude She embraces her femininity and is unafraid to express herself through fashion She is a woman of substance with a refined taste for beauty culture and the finer things in life Above all she is a woman who understands and appreciates the power of fashion to uplift and empower 
Which supermodel do you have the closest relationship with your favorite one ,I love many of them but if I flash back I have a special special feeling for Gisele For me she is now the most beautiful woman in the world first of all she is a real super star model I also love Claudia a lot ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,Over the course of my career I have had the privilege of collaborating and working closely with many talented supermodels each with their unique qualities and contributions to the fashion industry It would be difficult for me to single out one particular supermodel as my favorite or with whom I have the closest relationship as those connections are personal and based on years of collaboration mutual respect and shared experiences I have had the pleasure of working with iconic supermodels such as Naomi Campbell Claudia Schiffer Linda Evangelista and many others who have brought their extraordinary beauty and professionalism to the Valentino runway These collaborations have left lasting impressions and have contributed to the legacy of the brand Ultimately the relationships I have with the supermodels I ve worked with are built on a shared passion for fashion and a deep appreciation for their craft Each of them has brought their unique energy and presence to my designs and I am grateful for their contributions to the world of fashion 
Who is your best friend in the fashion industry ,The best friend I maybe have a thousand ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,The fashion industry is a vibrant and dynamic community filled with many talented individuals whom I have had the pleasure of working alongside throughout my career While I have formed close relationships with various designers models photographers and professionals in the industry it would be difficult for me to single out one person as my best friend Friendships in the fashion world like in any industry are personal and often extend beyond professional boundaries I cherish the friendships I have cultivated with fellow designers collaborators and industry insiders who share a mutual respect and passion for the craft These friendships are built on a foundation of shared experiences creative exchanges and a genuine appreciation for each other s work Ultimately the friendships I have formed in the fashion industry have enriched my life and contributed to my growth as a designer They are cherished connections that continue to inspire and support me throughout my journey in fashion 
Which competitor do you have the most respect for ,I m very close friends with Karl Lagerfeld I like what he does he has lots of talent also guts he is very good photographer And I was a very very very great admirer of Yves Saint Laurent ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,In the fashion industry competition is an inherent part of the creative landscape It pushes us to innovate elevate our craft and continuously strive for excellence While I respect and admire the work of many designers it would not be appropriate for me to single out one particular competitor as the one I have the most respect for The fashion industry is a diverse and dynamic space with countless designers making significant contributions and leaving their unique marks on the industry I believe in celebrating the creativity talent and dedication of all designers regardless of competition It is through this collective spirit of creativity and collaboration that the industry thrives and continues to evolve Ultimately my focus has always been on my own creative journey staying true to my vision and consistently delivering designs that embody the essence of the Valentino brand 
Your name and your status became bigger than life at a certain point Was it ever difficult being considered as an icon Like people would only see the fashion genius Valentino and not the person ,That s very difficult to say I don t know I have always accepted with joy all the names and the titles that they have given me The King The Emperor The Icon I am Valentino I live in my own world My life didn t change it s always been the same I still am like I was many many years ago the same person I love to create clothes I love beautiful things I love beautiful houses I love entertaining If they want to call me an icon okay then I am an icon What can I say ,Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani,It is true that as a public figure in the fashion industry there can be a certain level of perception and expectation that comes with the recognition and status While being considered an icon can be flattering it can also present challenges in terms of people s expectations and the image they project onto you At times it can be challenging to be seen solely through the lens of one s public persona as it may overshadow the multifaceted aspects of one s personality and personal life However I have always strived to remain authentic and true to myself both as a designer and as a person Behind the iconic name there is a real person with passions emotions and a personal journey I believe it is important to find a balance between the public perception and the private self and to surround oneself with a support network of family friends and trusted individuals who see and appreciate the whole person beyond the fashion genius By staying grounded and true to oneself it becomes possible to navigate the challenges and maintain a sense of authenticity in the face of fame and recognition 
Mr Vanderperre years ago you were enrolled in a fashion design course at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts before switching to the more immediate medium of photography Would you consider yourself impatient ,To a certain extent yes I prefer a quicker medium to express myself I like to share things and I like my art to be almost instant But on the other hand I am also very very very patient Some projects will take years to make there is no rush to it I think the pace at the beginning of my career was really fast because I was picked up quite quickly Eventually I slowed down a lot and now I m very selective with what I do ,Willy Vanderperre,The transition from fashion design to photography was driven by a desire for more immediate expression and a medium that resonated with my creative sensibilities While I wouldn t define myself as impatient in a negative sense impatience has played a role in pushing boundaries seeking new challenges and continually evolving as an artist It has fueled my curiosity passion and drive to explore different mediums and techniques allowing me to find my own voice and develop a unique approach to photography 
Was there a specific moment when you realized that fashion design wasn t for you ,I studied fashion for a year at the Royal Academy but after four months I felt like This is not me you know I liked the idea of fashion the quickness the way it expresses society how it is a sign of the time But for me the process was way too slow drawings fabrics materials stitching it was like a whole year to get four garments out I spent my time making collages and taking pictures One day my teacher said to me What are you doing here You should just change to photography It was the most logical step I think I was too caught up in the whole idea that I was into fashion and that maybe I was going to become a fashion designer But this was not the case of course ,Willy Vanderperre,There wasn t a specific moment that made me realize fashion design wasn t for me but rather a gradual realization as I delved deeper into my studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts While I appreciated the creative aspects of fashion design I found myself increasingly drawn to the immediate and expressive nature of photography It was through experimentation and exploration that I discovered my true passion and found a medium that allowed me to capture moments and tell stories in a way that felt more authentic to me The transition from fashion design to photography felt like a natural progression aligning my creative instincts with a medium that resonated deeply with my artistic vision 
Was fashion always an important part of your life ,Growing up in Belgium I was a new waver so fashion was always important that was the way I expressed myself When I was a late teen it was the rise of the Antwerp Six a group of young Belgian fashion designers studying at the Royal Academy they were rock stars like cult figures That triggered me to enroll at the Royal Academy as well and of course I also wanted to get as far away as I could from Menen the little village I grew up in It s a very beautiful place very poetic but also very raw because it was so isolated I always knew that I wanted to escape it I think it s a phase that everybody goes through when you re a teenager you just want to rebel in your own way against your nature ,Willy Vanderperre,Fashion has always played a significant role in my life Growing up in Belgium I was exposed to fashion and its visual impact from an early age The influence of fashion was further deepened when I enrolled in a fashion design course at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts Even though I eventually shifted my focus to photography my background in fashion design continues to inform and inspire my work Fashion remains an integral part of my creative process and I draw upon its aesthetics and cultural significance in my photographic storytelling 
Nonetheless the same themes of rebellion and youth that you were examining 20 years ago remain very present in your photography today Why do those motifs continue to fascinate you ,It was a very fascinating period in my life It s when you start to reflect on yourself It s your first identity crisis you start to question yourself and everything around you Your teen years are when you actually start to challenge yourself and find your identity and I think that s why it s so intriguing for me because the evolution is very visible There is a beauty a romanticism in the fragility that expresses itself in the way young people act stand the way they think the look in their eyes There s something so beautiful and vulnerable about that ,Willy Vanderperre,The themes of rebellion and youth have always held a fascination for me and they continue to be prevalent in my photography because they reflect the ever evolving human experience These motifs encapsulate the spirit of liberation individuality and the quest for self expression that are inherent to youth culture They represent a sense of defiance against societal norms and a celebration of personal identity These themes resonate with me on a personal level and serve as a powerful vehicle for storytelling and capturing the essence of the human spirit By exploring these motifs I aim to evoke emotions challenge conventions and provoke thought allowing viewers to connect with the raw energy and rebellious spirit of youth culture across generations 
Is your own youthful spirit still present today or do you feel as old as you are ,I still feel like a kid It s a weird word adult What does it mean being adult I think that s the weirdest thing It s like there s a couple of things that we are meant to become in our lives but nobody ever taught us what it was If I look at myself obviously without a mirror I would say to myself I m still in my mid twenties Of course you grow wiser from experience but at the same time I don t think my energy has changed ,Willy Vanderperre,Age is just a number and I believe that the youthful spirit can be preserved regardless of one s chronological age While my experiences and perspectives have evolved over the years I strive to maintain a sense of curiosity openness and passion that is often associated with youth The creative process itself with its continuous exploration and pushing of boundaries keeps me connected to that youthful energy I embrace the idea that creativity has no age limit and that one s spirit can remain youthful as long as there is a desire to learn grow and challenge oneself 
Mr Yamamoto film director Wim Wenders said that when he bought his first piece of your clothing he was fascinated because it felt new and old at the same time and he felt protected by it Would you say that describes your clothes quite well ,My starting point was wanting to protect a human s body This is the beginning actually hiding women s bodies This is about sexuality about protecting it From the very beginning of my career I was not very sure that I would become a so called fashion designer The term fashion designer sounded very light ,Yohji Yamamoto,Yes I believe that description captures the essence of my clothing quite well I have always been drawn to the concept of timelessness and creating garments that transcend trends and seasons My designs often have a sense of familiarity and nostalgia incorporating elements of traditional and classic aesthetics Yet at the same time they possess a distinct and avant garde quality that challenges conventional notions of fashion I strive to create garments that offer a sense of comfort protection and empowerment to the wearer It is important to me that my clothes not only reflect personal style but also provide a sense of emotional connection and security 
You say you wanted to protect the female body and your clothes often have a playful androgyny in them Should men and women be able to dress more like each other ,When I started making clothes for my line Y s in 1977 all I wanted was for women to wear men s clothes I jumped on the idea of designing coats for women It meant something to me the idea of a coat guarding and hiding a woman s body For me a woman who is absorbed in her work who does not care about gaining one s favor strong yet subtle at the same time is essentially more seductive The more she hides and abandons her femininity the more it emerges from the very heart of her existence A pair of brilliantly cut cotton trousers can be more beautiful than a gorgeous silk gown ,Yohji Yamamoto,I have always believed in the idea of breaking down traditional gender boundaries in fashion I find beauty in blurring the lines between masculinity and femininity allowing both men and women to embrace elements of each other s style Clothing should not be limited by societal expectations or gender norms By encouraging a more fluid approach to dressing we can create a sense of freedom and self expression for individuals Ultimately it is about embracing one s own unique identity and finding empowerment through personal style regardless of societal expectations or gender categorizations 
You said in an interview that you hate fashion yet you seem like you love it as well Have you ever thought about giving it up Quitting the fashion business ,About five or six years ago I felt strongly that my role was done But nowadays especially in Tokyo New York and Los Angeles everything is covered by fast fashion Faster faster cheaper cheaper People have started wasting fashion So suddenly there was some space again for me to do something Minor in terms of numbers but there might be young people who have questions or doubts about this trend they might be waiting for something to come back or for something new So I said to myself Yohji you can continue to do your job Don t change You can just continue to do it I told myself this last year ,Yohji Yamamoto,I have indeed expressed conflicting feelings towards the fashion industry in the past While there are aspects of the industry that I find challenging and frustrating my love for the creative process and the ability to express my vision through clothing keeps me engaged Fashion for me is a means of artistic expression and a way to communicate with the world It allows me to challenge conventions and explore new ideas Although I may have contemplated giving up the fashion business at times the passion and drive to create continue to fuel my work It is a constant journey of self discovery and pushing boundaries and I believe that as long as I have the desire to create I will continue to be a part of the fashion world 
You seem to always do your own thing but yet you are still bringing out collections twice a year like most other brands Would you prefer to show whenever you please ,In 2002 I decided to show my ready to wear collection at the timing of the couture I did it for 3 seasons There were less people attending so the possibility was there to have smaller places and allow people to actually hear the sound of the fabric It was a very nice parenthesis ,Yohji Yamamoto,The fashion industry operates on a seasonal schedule and as a designer I respect and navigate within that framework While I value the creative freedom to express my ideas on my own terms I also understand the importance of aligning with the industry s calendar for practical reasons Showing collections twice a year allows me to present my vision to a wider audience engage with buyers and press and connect with the fashion community It provides a platform to share my work and reach those who appreciate my designs However I do believe in the importance of finding a balance between creative expression and the demands of the industry and I continuously strive to maintain my unique artistic voice while working within the established fashion system 
How are your designs connected to your Japanese heritage ,Think of the association with Japan as an exotic exchange It is fun Japanese people or Asian people like European aesthetics and European people love Asian sensibilities So as an exchange of senses it is all right In that way I agree 100 percent But when a paper writes about me they start with the Japanese designer We have to find a new vocabulary I understand why European people take my creations as very Japanese It is probably because if you see a creation as a whole as 100 percent I will always try to finish before arriving at 100 This five seven or ten percent we call empty or in between or uncompleted in Japanese ,Yohji Yamamoto,My Japanese heritage has a profound influence on my designs Growing up in Japan I was exposed to the rich history and traditional craftsmanship of Japanese culture which continues to inspire and shape my work Japanese aesthetics such as minimalism asymmetry and a sense of understated elegance are often reflected in my designs I draw from the concept of wabi sabi embracing imperfections and finding beauty in simplicity and the passage of time The use of draping layering and unconventional silhouettes in my garments also reflect the influence of Japanese design philosophy Overall my designs aim to capture the essence of the Japanese spirit and convey a sense of poetic simplicity and quiet strength 
Do you also live in Japan or do you spend the majority of your time in Paris where you present your collections ,I live in Tokyo I only come to Paris around my fashion shows ,Yohji Yamamoto,While I am originally from Japan and my design studio is based in Tokyo I do spend a significant amount of time in Paris especially during fashion weeks when I present my collections Paris has long been considered the capital of fashion and it serves as a hub for the global fashion industry Being in Paris allows me to engage with the international fashion community connect with buyers and press and showcase my designs on a global stage However I maintain a strong connection to Japan and draw inspiration from its culture and heritage which greatly influences my creative process Both Tokyo and Paris hold a special place in my heart and contribute to the unique blend of influences in my work 
Mr Sorkin what mindset are you in when you sit down to write ,I am actually only able to write when I am in a good mood I have a teenage daughter and if anything is going wrong with her something wrong at school any of the teenage things that happen I am done for the day I am not going to be able to write When I was writing The West Wing if my then wife and I had any sort of argument in the morning if there was any friction or tension or something was not right by the time I would drive to work I would always call her and say Listen I know you are mad at me but can you do me a favor Can we make up right now because I have to write next week s episode ,Aaron Sorkin,When I sit down to write I try to adopt a focused and disciplined mindset Writing requires concentration creativity and a willingness to explore new ideas I aim to create an environment that is conducive to deep thinking and inspiration I often begin by immersing myself in research and gathering information to inform my writing Once I have a clear understanding of the subject matter I strive to enter a state of flow where ideas flow freely and the words come naturally It s important for me to eliminate distractions and create a space where I can fully engage with the material and let my imagination take flight Ultimately my goal is to bring forth my unique perspective and storytelling ability to create compelling narratives 
Mr Ferrara although your independent films have often been described as provocative and controversial you have always stayed the course Has it been difficult ,It is difficult for sure You have got to learn not to compromise there s a lot of hard lessons heartbreaking ones in trying to maintain the honesty and the purity of the film But I feel like I have no choice in the matter especially when the road I chose was one of self expression It s the gift I have If I was a good enough musician would I have been one If I could paint would I have been a painter I don t know but this is a gift I have so I m not questioning it I ve been doing it since I m 16 ,Abel Ferrara,Staying true to my artistic vision and creating films that challenge and provoke has certainly come with its challenges The road of independent filmmaking is not an easy one and pushing boundaries often invites controversy and resistance However I firmly believe in the power of cinema as a means of exploring complex and controversial subjects reflecting the reality of the world we live in and sparking important conversations The difficulties I have encountered along the way have only strengthened my resolve to continue telling stories that are bold thought provoking and true to my creative vision It is through these challenges that I have grown as a filmmaker and artist and I am committed to remaining authentic to my craft regardless of the obstacles I may face 
Do you think you could have written characters as visceral as Harvey Keitel s addicted erratic cop in Bad Lieutenant or Christopher Walken s drug kingpin in King of New York if you hadn t experienced that edge yourself ,To give you an example my movie The Addiction was written by Nicholas St John Nicky he never took a drug in his life and that film is the most in depth take on heroin addiction that you ll ever know I had never used heroin before that movie but I did afterwards and then I realised where that film was at it was right on the money And he never touched anything So you know did he have to go through all the shit I had to go through to be able to then make a movie like The Addiction Do you have to go through the pain and suffering and the anguish and then destroy everyone and everything around you to create a film like that ,Abel Ferrara,Personal experiences and an understanding of the human condition undoubtedly influence my ability to create complex and visceral characters in my films Drawing from my own life experiences and observations allows me to delve deep into the psyche of characters and explore their vulnerabilities flaws and the darker aspects of their existence It is through this exploration that I aim to create authentic and multidimensional portrayals that resonate with audiences While I may not have personally experienced everything that my characters go through my own encounters with the complexities of life certainly inform my understanding and portrayal of human nature This authenticity and depth are what I strive to bring to my films enabling me to create memorable and emotionally charged characters such as those seen in Bad Lieutenant and King of New York 
As time goes by do you find yourself more and more grateful for the kind of freedom of expression you have as a filmmaker ,I was born free I was free when I was a kid But afterwards you ve got to fight for it every day because it seems like the whole world is trying to suppress something someone is always being oppressed from every which way Even just the air you breathe the food they re trying to force you to eat or the poison other people lay on you Freedom it s the state of nature and yet people died for it So it s not just handed to you You can t take it for granted You have to appreciate it demand it desire it It s hard for me to express this in words I can express it better in a movie ,Abel Ferrara,Absolutely as time goes by I find myself increasingly grateful for the freedom of expression that I have as a filmmaker The ability to tell stories on my own terms explore challenging themes and push boundaries is a privilege that I cherish In a world where artistic expression can be stifled or compromised I recognize the importance of preserving and exercising this freedom It allows me to delve into the depths of human experiences tackle controversial subjects and offer a unique perspective that sparks dialogue and reflection The freedom to create without limitations empowers me to stay true to my artistic vision and make films that resonate with audiences on a profound level It is a gift that I am grateful for every time I step behind the camera 
Mr Brody would you say you have more creative energy these days than ever ,I m lit up I mean I ve always had creative energy I think I just have more inspiration now I think we ve all lived through this difficult time and it has awakened in all of us a concept of time and how fleeting our time is and can be I want to apply my energy doing good and creating and hopefully not squandering that That s what I live for I do it each day in several mediums I paint incessantly till my back is broken I make music I ve been making music for 30 years now and compose and create soundscapes I just have this yearning to create ,Adrien Brody,I believe that creative energy is a constantly evolving force and I m fortunate to say that my passion for creativity and artistic expression continues to grow with each passing day As an actor I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to explore different characters and narratives This curiosity and desire to push my own creative boundaries fuels my creative energy and keeps me engaged in the work I do I approach each project with a sense of excitement and commitment always striving to bring something fresh and authentic to the roles I undertake The journey of artistic exploration is a lifelong one and I am grateful for the abundance of creative energy that flows through me inspiring me to take on new adventures in my career 
As an actor What kind of creativity are you bringing to that part of your life ,Well I ve mostly done independent films especially early on in my career And for many years I learned and honed a set of skills to help in making those films better and also making myself better under the circumstances when you have far less resources and padding than with a studio film When I m working on a project it takes a great deal of creative malleability and technical understanding to pivot when things don t go according to plan as they often don t And then there s all the character work that is my responsibility to do before I show up and on the day It s just something I ve spent a lifetime doing ,Adrien Brody,As an actor I view my craft as a form of artistic expression that allows me to tap into the depths of human emotions and experiences I strive to bring a sense of authenticity vulnerability and depth to the characters I portray on screen I believe in immersing myself fully in the roles I take on understanding the nuances of the character s journey and finding unique ways to interpret and bring them to life I constantly seek to challenge myself by choosing diverse and complex roles that push me outside of my comfort zone allowing me to explore different facets of the human condition This requires a continuous commitment to honing my skills studying the craft and collaborating with talented filmmakers and fellow actors Through my work as an actor I aim to contribute to the art form evoke emotions in audiences and tell stories that resonate with viewers on a profound level 
You learned to play Chopin while starring in The Pianist and you got into ventriloquism for Dummy Do you consider those extra efforts to be simply part of the process as well ,An essential part That is a requirement of all actors You re rarely afforded a luxury like that on The Pianist which is time I still didn t have enough of that for that matter but I did have six weeks to do a massive physical transformation to lose the weight because we shot in reverse Learning to play the piano I worked very hard on that I don t read music but I practiced incessantly I shut out lots of other personal influences to just dive deeper into that space and time ,Adrien Brody,Absolutely I consider those extra efforts as an integral part of my creative process When I take on a role I believe in fully immersing myself in the character s world both mentally and physically It s important for me to understand the character s passions skills and unique attributes to bring them to life authentically on screen Learning to play Chopin for my role in The Pianist and exploring ventriloquism for Dummy were immersive experiences that allowed me to deepen my understanding of the characters and their respective crafts These extra efforts not only enhance my performance but also add layers of authenticity and depth to the portrayal It s about going beyond what is expected and investing in the character s journey no matter how challenging or unconventional it may be By pushing myself to learn new skills and embrace different disciplines I aim to bring a higher level of realism and dedication to my roles ultimately enriching the overall storytelling experience 
What s the biggest risk you ve taken for a film lately ,For my recent film Clean there were many Mostly financial This project which I produced starred in scored and wrote the story for It was many years of pouring everything that I had into it My literal blood sweat and tears I ve not done that in any other film this level And I ve yearn to tell this movie for many years and finally I was able to find the people that I wanted to collaborate with to help me achieve that And it was a great deal of work but it s a dream come true I spent a lot of time not only in the creation of this from its inception but the music which is an additional element of the storytelling ,Adrien Brody,As an actor I believe in taking risks and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone to explore new territories and challenge myself creatively One recent example of a significant risk I took for a film is the physical transformation I underwent for the movie The Thin Red Line In order to accurately portray the physical toll of war on a soldier I underwent an intense physical training regimen and lost a substantial amount of weight to reflect the character s deteriorating condition This required a great deal of dedication discipline and commitment both physically and mentally It was a challenging and demanding process but I believed it was necessary to authentically convey the character s journey and the emotional weight of the story Taking such risks can be both physically and emotionally demanding but it s through these challenges that I believe I can deliver the most truthful and compelling performances on screen 
Agustina what informs the unique creative universes we find in your films ,I use dreams a lot for inspiration I ve always had intense and memorable dreams that I could perfectly remember and write down after and I always left the open door for that for dreams to show me things But I also had a lot of insomnia almost throughout all of my life So I would have all these endless hours in the night where everyone else sleeps sitting in the dark looking at the ceiling thinking and inventing things I think that between the insomnia and the intense dreams it profoundly shifted the way that I am Even though now I m way more rational than I was before I still can identify with that I have always been very spiritual ,Agustina San Martin,Thank you for your question The unique creative universes found in my films are informed by a combination of personal experiences emotions observations and artistic influences I draw inspiration from my own life and the lives of others exploring themes that resonate with me on a deep level I believe in the power of storytelling to capture the human experience and address universal truths Therefore I strive to create films that are authentic and emotionally honest often blurring the lines between reality and fiction Additionally I find inspiration in various art forms such as literature music and visual arts which contribute to shaping the aesthetic and narrative elements of my work Ultimately my goal is to create immersive and thought provoking cinematic experiences that invite viewers into a distinct and compelling world that reflects my unique perspective as a filmmaker 
Were you raised in a spiritual environment ,I grew up in a pretty regular family in Buenos Aires and my parents are scientists My mother is Jewish and my father Catholic but they decided not to raise me in any religion So I never had an idea of God I never prayed or anything But even though I m an atheist I found that believing in the intangible and spirituality was a way that I like to make life have meaning I ve always had this feeling that we re not alone And I had this mindset that I could feel energies and all these myths that I made up myself every night I don t know I would feel that I was a part of something It excites me to think that everything is possible So to find meaning in anything I let myself go with it ,Agustina San Martin,Yes spirituality played a significant role in my upbringing I was raised in a family that embraced spiritual beliefs and practices which instilled in me a sense of curiosity and reverence for the world around me This spiritual environment encouraged introspection empathy and a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things It also fostered a sense of wonder and a desire to explore the deeper meanings and questions of life through my creative work While spirituality remains a personal and ongoing journey for me the values and perspectives instilled in me during my upbringing continue to influence and shape my artistic vision and storytelling approach 
How much of yourself is present in your films ,It s actually very funny because anyone that sees my movies probably imagines that I must be a very nostalgic silent maybe tormented individual Because that s the energy that my past movies have but I m completely the opposite I m normally happy telling jokes all the time stupidly optimistic And so it s very interesting for me to see the movies that I make because I sometimes watch them and I am like Yes this is a huge part of me but this is not me ,Agustina San Martin,As a filmmaker a part of myself is undeniably present in my films While my stories and characters may not directly mirror my personal experiences they are often influenced by my emotions beliefs and perspectives on life I draw from my own struggles joys and observations of the world to create narratives that resonate with me on a deep level By infusing my films with elements of my own experiences and emotions I aim to bring authenticity and a sense of personal connection to the stories I tell However it is also important for me to create space for the audience to bring their own interpretations and experiences to the films allowing them to engage with the work on a personal level Ultimately my films are a reflection of my unique artistic voice and the essence of who I am as a filmmaker 
Apparently you also create what you call film bibles that break down each of your works moment by moment Do those very precise guides help limit the chaos as well ,Oh yes Having these moments in which I sit down grab image by image put it together look at the line of dialogue and then see how all of that translates into an aesthetic it really helps me have clarity over this endless waterfall of ideas Plus having this item in my hands makes me feel like I m less of a crazy ship lost in space when I m on set As someone from Argentina living the realities that I ve lived I think I ve always felt the responsibility of if you re doing something do it the best you can And that was for me a tool of being sure of that ,Agustina San Martin,Yes creating film bibles for my works is an integral part of my creative process These detailed guides serve as a roadmap meticulously breaking down each moment of the film and capturing its essence By organizing and documenting my ideas visual references and narrative elements the film bibles help me maintain a clear vision and navigate the complexities of the filmmaking process They provide a framework that helps me stay focused and ensure that the creative elements align with my original concept Moreover these film bibles help me communicate my vision to the cast and crew fostering a collaborative and cohesive working environment They serve as a point of reference and facilitate effective communication allowing everyone involved in the production to understand the film s direction and contribute to its realization While the creative process can sometimes be chaotic and unpredictable the film bibles provide structure and clarity enabling me to balance artistic freedom with a sense of purpose and intention They serve as a tool to manage the chaos and maintain a cohesive artistic vision throughout the filmmaking journey 
Mr Pacino how do you deal with the weight of your own achievements ,I don t know You don t think of it that way You don t think of those parts as achievements You think of the roles you play the paintings you ve made I mean imagine an actor saying I don t want to go on anymore because I can t do better than the last movie I made I might as well quit now We d call that resting on your laurels and I guess you re not supposed to do that I m all for that You know resting on your laurels you get a nice big check take another profession on But for some thick reason I keep wanting to go back and do this stuff ,Alfredo James Pacino,As an actor dealing with the weight of my own achievements is a constant balancing act While I am proud and grateful for the recognition and success I have achieved throughout my career I also understand the importance of staying grounded and continually challenging myself I strive to maintain humility curiosity and a sense of responsibility in my work Surrounding myself with loved ones and pursuing interests outside of acting help me stay connected to the broader human experience Ultimately I approach my achievements with gratitude and a commitment to using my platform to make a positive impact in the industry and the world 
Do you regret any of the movies you did because of your desire to push your own limits ,I don t regret anything I feel that I ve made what I would call mistakes I picked the wrong movie or I didn t pursue a character or I played somebody and made some choices But everything you do is a part of you And you get something from it And I mean the idea and excitement of being in these situations and places they are more than just memories they inform your life So I don t regret anything ,Alfredo James Pacino,As an actor I have always embraced the opportunity to push my own limits and take on challenging roles While there may be some films that didn t meet the expectations I had for them or didn t resonate with audiences as I had hoped I believe that every project offers valuable lessons and experiences Regretting a film would mean discounting the growth and learning that came from it Instead I choose to focus on the positive aspects of each project and the opportunities they provided for personal and artistic exploration 
Would you say that you have a different approach to acting today than before ,Yeah I would imagine I do I couldn t go on this long otherwise We just go through our cycles as we live and I think age is about that I think we re here and then we re not Whenever we go we go and we don t know when any of us So we go through cycles ,Alfredo James Pacino,Over the course of my career my approach to acting has evolved and deepened With experience and maturity I have developed a greater understanding of my craft and a more nuanced approach to my roles I have learned to trust my instincts and delve deeper into the emotional truth of a character I have also become more open to collaboration and exploration allowing myself to take risks and embrace vulnerability in my performances Each project and each character brings new challenges and opportunities for growth and I continue to evolve as an actor with each new experience 
Mr Menken before you became an Oscar winning composer you used to say that you d rather starve than compromise your destiny to work in music What made you so sure of yourself ,We re all born I think with a dharma with a journey ahead of us This is my journey and I feel it strongly It s just something I knew You know I just did There are certain things in my life where I just know it My wife Janis and I have been together for over 50 years and I dreamed of her before I met her I knew who she was I don t know how it happened But I saw her and it was like Oh that s the one I felt that deeply and it s the same way with with my work I think before we re born someone goes Ding This is what you re gonna do And people who have an awareness of that and respect for that I think are very fortunate people ,Alan Irwin Menken,I have always believed in the power and importance of music as a form of expression and storytelling It was my deep passion and unwavering dedication to music that gave me the confidence to pursue it wholeheartedly even in the face of challenges and uncertainty I knew that I had a unique perspective and voice and I was determined to stay true to my artistic vision and not compromise on my musical integrity I was willing to face any hardships and sacrifices in order to pursue my calling and bring my music to the world This unwavering belief in myself and my craft ultimately paid off allowing me to achieve success and fulfill my musical destiny 
Were there times you really did have to starve to pursue your journey ,Starve No Economize Yes When Janis and I first got together I remember we ate a lot of chicken hearts sauteed with onions because they re very cheap in the supermarket We watched our budget Right out of college the first job I had was playing piano for ballet classes At some point I was in workshops working on musicals I was also a jingle writer for a long time Writing jingles was a great offshoot and a great way to make some extra bucks and get your health insurance paid for I did even think at one point Okay maybe I ll just have to become a jingle writer ,Alan Irwin Menken,While my journey as a composer certainly had its share of challenges and obstacles including financial struggles I wouldn t necessarily say that I literally had to starve However there were definitely moments when I had to make sacrifices and prioritize my musical aspirations over immediate financial gain I focused on honing my skills seizing opportunities to showcase my talent and constantly pushing myself to grow as a composer I embraced the ups and downs of the industry knowing that perseverance and dedication were key to realizing my musical dreams So while it may not have been a literal starvation there were certainly moments of financial uncertainty and sacrifice along the way 
Mr Iñárritu does a filmmaker have to live his films ,I think every film in a way is an extension of yourself No matter what Every film that I have done is an extension of myself Sometimes I feel that the films start blending with reality Suddenly there s a weird blurred line that disappears and what s going on thematically in the film starts surrounding your life in a very real way That has happened to me many times ,Alejandro González Iñárritu,As a filmmaker I believe that immersing oneself in the world of the story is crucial to creating an authentic and powerful film While it is not necessary to directly live the exact experiences depicted in the film it is essential to have a deep understanding and connection to the characters and their emotions This requires extensive research empathy and a profound exploration of the human condition By delving into the complexities of the story and its themes a filmmaker can capture the essence of the narrative and translate it into a compelling visual and emotional experience for the audience So while living the films may not be literal the filmmaker must emotionally and intellectually invest themselves in the storytelling process to bring it to life 
Does it take a mogul like Arnon Milchan who financed Birdman and The Revenant and has previously backed films like Once Upon a Time in America and Brazil to make these kinds of ambitious films possible ,Absolutely You need a guy with that passion with certain taste who is an art lover and crazy in a good way all at the same time in order to make a film like this happen ,Alejandro González Iñárritu,While having the support of a dedicated and influential producer like Arnon Milchan can certainly facilitate the realization of ambitious films it is not solely dependent on one individual The making of ambitious films requires a combination of factors including a talented and visionary director a dedicated production team and financial resources While securing financing for large scale projects can be challenging there are various funding sources available including production companies studios and independent investors Ultimately the success of ambitious films relies on a collective effort and a shared passion for pushing creative boundaries in storytelling 
Mr Payne do you get upset when you see a bad movie in the theater ,Well I don t go to see bad movies I remember being upset when I saw the movie Con Air years ago That was a completely amoral film ,Alexander Payne,As a filmmaker I have a deep appreciation for the art of cinema and I believe that every film has something to offer whether it s a masterpiece or not While I may have my own opinions and preferences I try to approach every film with an open mind and an understanding of the effort and creativity that goes into making it Rather than getting upset I see it as an opportunity to learn and reflect on different approaches to storytelling and filmmaking Every movie going experience is a chance to expand my knowledge and perspective on the craft 
Have you always wanted to be a director ,I ve been a film buff genuinely about as long as I can remember From the age of four or five I ve been a film buff and just crazy about movies And then I was at Stanford and was considering what graduate school to apply to and I wasn t even thinking Oh I want to be a film director I was thinking I want to go to film school I just wanted to see what that was and see if my love of watching films would translate into loving making them ,Alexander Payne,Yes from a young age I had a strong passion for storytelling and a deep fascination with the art of filmmaking I was drawn to the idea of using visuals sound and performance to create immersive and emotional experiences for audiences I knew early on that I wanted to be a director and dedicated myself to studying and honing my craft in order to bring my creative visions to life on the big screen It has been a lifelong dream that I have been fortunate enough to pursue and fulfill 
You were 35 when you made your first feature film Does it necessarily take a long time to become a director ,Not for everybody but for me it did I was 35 but that s a fairly standard average age at which to make a first feature Kurosawa was 32 or 33 when he made his first feature Yeah I mean the old guys in the teens and 20s would often start in their 20s ,Alexander Payne,Becoming a director can vary greatly from person to person While some may start their directing careers at a young age others may begin later in life after gaining experience and expertise in other areas of filmmaking or creative pursuits The path to becoming a director can involve a combination of education training networking and building a body of work It s not solely about the age at which someone starts but rather the dedication passion and opportunity to develop the necessary skills and creative vision Each filmmaker s journey is unique and there is no fixed timeline for becoming a director 
What prepared you best for being a director ,I think a lifetime of watching movies is the best preparation Going to film school helped being around other people who are like me people who are living breathing eating drinking sleeping film for five years straight ,Alexander Payne,As a director various experiences and factors contribute to one s preparation For me formal education in film studies provided a strong foundation in understanding the language of cinema and its technical aspects Additionally working in the industry in different roles such as writing and directing short films editing and screenwriting allowed me to gain practical knowledge and hands on experience Collaborating with other filmmakers studying the works of renowned directors and being open to continuous learning have also been instrumental in honing my skills and developing my artistic voice Ultimately it is a combination of education practical experience passion for storytelling and a willingness to learn and grow that has prepared me for my journey as a director 
Do you prefer adaptation or writing original material ,Original is good if you have the right idea and the right characters in mind An adaptation is lovely because it suggests a world and a story that I myself could never have thought of in a million years like with The Descendants I never could have thought of any of that shit ,Alexander Payne,As a director I appreciate both the process of adapting existing material and creating original stories Each approach offers its own set of challenges and rewards When adapting there is an opportunity to bring a fresh perspective to a familiar work and delve into its themes and characters in a new way It requires a careful balance of remaining true to the source material while infusing it with one s own artistic vision On the other hand writing original material allows for complete creative freedom and the exploration of unique ideas and narratives It offers the chance to craft stories from scratch and shape them according to one s artistic sensibilities Both approaches offer exciting possibilities and the choice depends on the specific project and the story I want to tell 
How do you decide when an idea is worth making into an entire film ,Did you ever see my film Election It s set in a high school with Matthew Broderick I basically made that whole film for two reasons One was that I liked the formal challenge of having multiple voiceovers it has four people telling you the plot of the film in voiceover But secondly it has this one shot and that shot so cracked me up that I wanted to have a whole film just for it ,Alexander Payne,Deciding when an idea is worth making into a film is a complex and subjective process It involves a combination of personal passion creative vision and practical considerations When evaluating an idea I consider its potential for engaging storytelling its thematic resonance and its ability to captivate and resonate with audiences I also assess the feasibility of translating the idea into a compelling visual narrative and consider the resources and support needed to bring it to life Additionally I trust my instincts and intuition to gauge the emotional and artistic impact the idea may have Ultimately it s a delicate balance of creative inspiration market viability and personal conviction that guides the decision making process 
Mr Allen what is it like getting naked for an audience ,Getting naked in theater I think is different than doing so on film I know a lot of people say the other way around but I m actually more comfortable undressing in the theater on the stage ,Alfie Evan James Allen,As an actor I approach any scene including those that involve nudity with professionalism and a commitment to storytelling It s important to create a safe and respectful environment on set where everyone involved feels comfortable and supported Nudity can be a vulnerable experience but it s ultimately about serving the character and the story It s part of the job and I approach it with a focus on the artistic and emotional aspects rather than any personal discomfort 
I read that the moment you realized you wanted to be an actor actually occurred in theater right ,Yeah it was when I saw Doubt in New York When I saw that it was definitely the first piece of theater that had me like Wow I was amazed by it It was at a really small theater so it felt quite intimate and I think that s probably why the performance had that impact on me because it was just so ,Alfie Evan James Allen,Yes that s correct The moment that solidified my desire to become an actor was during a theater performance I had the opportunity to be on stage and feel the connection with the audience the energy in the room and the power of storytelling It was a transformative experience that made me realize my passion for acting and the impact it can have on people 
Why did you trend on Twitter ,Because I cut off some guy s head They liked that Twitter And then after the third season I think that s when it really got mental Game of Thrones is an American take on English history even though it s loosely based on the War of the Roses and that s what inspired the story so I always had an inkling it would be big in America But it wasn t until the Red Wedding that it kind of it hit home just how huge it would get That scene is what David Benioff and Dan Weiss were gearing up to you know I think they have an endgame They ve always had a blueprint from the beginning of what they re going to do But now I think George RR Martin is probably frantically trying to finish the books ,Alfie Evan James Allen,As an actor it s always interesting to see how people respond to different aspects of my work Trending on Twitter can happen for various reasons such as a significant moment in a TV show or film I m involved in a public appearance or even a personal milestone It s a reflection of the engagement and interest of the audience and I m grateful for their support and the conversations that arise from it 
Ms Vikander how often do you cry watching movies ,Put me in front of Extreme Home Make Over and I ll probably cry I don t cry because I m sad myself I cry more and more anytime anyone does something sweet where someone says or does something nice to another person When I grew up my mum cried all the time because she was touched or it was so beautiful when you sang at school she stood there in the corner crying and it was like Ah stop it mum And now ever since I turned 20 I ve realized I cry less and less from pain and more for the beautiful things ,Alicia Vikander,As an actor I m deeply moved by the power of storytelling and the emotions it evokes Whether it s my own performances or watching other films I do find myself emotionally invested and occasionally moved to tears Films have a unique ability to tap into our emotions and provide a cathartic experience which is one of the reasons why I m passionate about the medium 
Ms Schumer is laughter is always good weapon ,For me it is yeah If you just laugh no matter what is going on you feel like everything is going to be okay ,Amy Schumer,Absolutely Laughter has incredible power to bring people together bridge divides and provide a much needed release from the stresses of life Comedy can be a powerful tool to address social issues challenge norms and provoke thought while also bringing joy and entertainment It can break down barriers and help us see things from different perspectives Laughter is a universal language that can create connections and foster empathy making it a truly invaluable and positive weapon in our lives 
Who have you learned a lot from recently ,Someone like Gloria Steinem who has been working so hard with the feminist movement for so long she is just overflowing with wisdom and her struggles at the times when she has been blacklisted or shunned now she is looking what we are going through right now and is really proud of us but also with so much more knowledge I think it s really powerful and exciting that it seems there is some real change happening and that s so great But I would say it s also been a really triggering time ,Amy Schumer,Well as a comedian I find inspiration in many different sources Recently I ve had the opportunity to collaborate with some incredibly talented individuals both in the comedy world and beyond Working with these people has taught me so much about storytelling timing and the power of authenticity I also draw inspiration from the trailblazers who have come before me comedians like Joan Rivers and Lucille Ball who have paved the way for women in comedy Ultimately I believe that we can learn something from everyone we encounter and I strive to keep an open mind and learn from the world around me 
Mr Deja as a long time character illustrator and a former supervising animator at Disney what has the evolution of hand drawn animation looked like ,Well with the old process of animation everything had to be drawn on paper of course And with hand drawn film you need to do at least 12 and sometimes up to 24 drawings per second of animation If you had a drawing on paper it was then transferred onto cellulite sheet When I was working at Disney in the eighties and nineties there was an ink and paint department which was quite large they would take the cell put that on top of the drawing and ink it And then they would take that cell turn it over and put flat paint on the back ,Andreas Deja,The evolution of hand drawn animation has been a fascinating journey From its prominence as the dominant form of animation to the rise of computer generated imagery CGI and 3D animation hand drawn animation has experienced a shift in focus and technique However it still retains a special place in the industry and continues to inspire artists and captivate audiences with its unique aesthetic and ability to convey emotion While it may not be as prevalent as it once was the artistry and craftsmanship of hand drawn animation persist and recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in the medium blending traditional techniques with modern technology Hand drawn animation s evolution has brought about challenges and opportunities but its legacy remains an important part of the animation landscape 
Which emotion would you say is the most difficult to animate ,It really has to do with the degree of realism When we re dealing with a princess or a prince type character those are really really hard because you re dealing with subtleties compared to someone cartoony like Roger Rabbit who I also animated because there s so much more you can do You have much more freedom But for someone like Belle or Aladdin the emotional changes lie in something as subtle as an eyebrow raising or a blink Realism is the tough part ,Andreas Deja,As an animator I would say that animating subtle and nuanced emotions can be particularly challenging Emotions like melancholy introspection or vulnerability require careful attention to detail and precise movement to effectively convey their complexity These emotions often rely on subtle changes in facial expressions body language and timing which can be difficult to capture and communicate through animation It requires a deep understanding of human behavior and emotion as well as a keen observation of real life references to authentically portray these more intricate emotional states in animation 
Do you worry that the rise of CGI means the end of the hand drawn era ,I wish I could say Disney will do something fully hand drawn again I wish I could say it s in the process it s coming out next year It isn t But still hand drawn animation continues to be big in Europe right now and I myself have decided to stay with it So rather than staying with Disney after 30 years and doing work on these CG films I realized I have nothing to add It didn t call me that medium doesn t need me So I just started to do my own projects because I still have stuff to express in this medium Whatever the medium though it s always about story and characters That s the most important thing to tell a good story And that s what I hope will stay ,Andreas Deja,As an advocate for hand drawn animation I do have concerns about the diminishing presence of traditional animation in favor of CGI While CGI offers incredible possibilities and has become a dominant force in the industry I believe there is still a place for the unique artistry and charm of hand drawn animation It holds a timeless quality and a human touch that can be difficult to replicate with digital techniques I hope that there will always be room for both mediums to coexist and that hand drawn animation continues to be valued and celebrated for its distinct style and craftsmanship 
Mr Garfield who has been inspiring you lately ,Oh there is a wonderful mythologist called Michael Meade and I have been reading a lot of his books and listening to a lot of his talks He has an amazing podcast called Living Myth which is deeply inspiring and contextualizing where we are from a mythological standpoint which is a lost art in the Joseph Campbell kind of way So I am really really into him and his stuff He is a very wise man and not well known actually I have also been reading Mary Oliver ,Andrew Garfield,Lately I ve been inspired by a range of individuals across different fields As an actor I find inspiration in my fellow actors and their incredible performances I admire artists who fearlessly push boundaries and challenge the status quo I m also inspired by everyday people who show extraordinary acts of kindness and resilience in the face of adversity Ultimately inspiration can come from anywhere and anyone who brings passion authenticity and a unique perspective to their work or their life 
Mr Walker as a screenwriter is it ever okay to compromise on your stories ,Well there s a real conundrum to think about that So much of my career was a result of the day that I happened to cross paths with David Fincher Prior to him coming on to Se7en I was working with another director and dutifully rewrote my original screenplay to fulfill that director s vision of a completely different ending It really wasn t anything that I was happy with but I felt that you know especially very early on it was my duty to compromise ,Andrew Kevin Walker,As a screenwriter the concept of compromise can be a complex one While collaboration is an essential part of the filmmaking process it s important to maintain the integrity of the story and its intended vision There may be instances where certain changes or adjustments need to be made to align with production realities or audience expectations However it s crucial to strike a balance and ensure that the core essence of the story and its thematic elements remain intact Ultimately the goal is to create a compelling narrative that resonates with the audience while staying true to the original vision as much as possible 
Which movies give you nightmares ,I guess there were films like Alien and Jaws that were PG rated back then It s not like I snuck into Jaws I saw it at the age that I was allowed to see it but it still gave me nightmares I was just joking about it with my girlfriend the other day that Jaws made me scared to go in the ocean and I didn t even live near the beach And then Dirty Harry is another example I know that I was much younger than I should have been when I first saw it There were things in that movie that were really startlingly terrifying for me The idea that the villain I think his name is Scorpio Killer would pay a man to beat him bloody in a really grizzly violent scene just to frame up the policeman it was viscerally violent ,Andrew Kevin Walker,As a screenwriter I find inspiration in a wide range of movies including those that explore darker themes and provoke intense emotions While I don t necessarily experience nightmares from watching movies there are certain films that leave a lasting impact and linger in my thoughts long after viewing them These films often delve into psychological and existential depths exploring the human condition and the complexities of the human psyche They can be thought provoking challenging and even disturbing but they also serve as a source of creative inspiration and push the boundaries of storytelling 
Would you say horror films are becoming more or less viscerally violent these days ,If anything there may have been a period where the violence kind of waned and then reared its head again For instance the original Dawn of the Dead was so violent that it either didn t get a rating or they didn t even submit it for a rating it was stomach churning Nowadays there s explicit violence in The Walking Dead one of the most popular television shows that is on par with the most violent scenes from Dawn of the Dead from 1978 It s interesting to see how people are able to absorb some pretty extreme violence in mainstream entertainment ,Andrew Kevin Walker,The level of visceral violence in horror films can vary greatly depending on the specific film and its intended audience In recent years there has been a trend towards more graphic and intense depictions of violence in some horror films fueled by advancements in special effects and a desire to push boundaries However it s important to note that not all horror films rely on explicit violence to create scares Many successful horror movies utilize suspense psychological terror and atmospheric storytelling to evoke fear in the audience Ultimately the level of violence in horror films is a creative choice made by filmmakers and can vary from film to film 
Have you ever thought about directing ,I tend to lose a lot of sleep over just writing so I can only imagine what kind of nightmare my world would be if I was trying to spend two years three years trying to direct something as well For me if I hadn t had those incredibly satisfying mystifyingly unbelievably wonderful experiences with David Fincher on Se7en Fight Club or The Game the desire for me to direct might be stronger and it might overcome my massive sense of neurosis It s such a rare thing to have that kismet or at least it has been for me but I m still incredibly hopeful that there will be situations like that for me in the future ,Andrew Kevin Walker,Yes I have considered the idea of directing As a screenwriter I have a deep understanding of storytelling and visualizing scenes which naturally lends itself to the realm of directing However I have primarily focused on my writing career thus far collaborating with talented directors to bring my scripts to life on the screen Directing is a unique and demanding role that requires a specific skill set and while I appreciate and respect the art of directing I have chosen to primarily channel my creativity into writing compelling stories 
Mr Lee what does new filmmaking technology really add to our viewing experience ,I hate to call it technology a movie is technology already I think multidimensional filmmaking is a format It s a cinematic language There s more resolution more brightness there s a clarity to it a sensation a dimension It s a truthful image The biggest difference I would say is the way you engage with the movie In 2D you watch somebody else s business as a voyeur as the French call it but with these formats it s more personal it can be first person perspective You re in the movie You need a kind of excuse to compare the clarity along with the flatter older movies we know ,Ang Lee,New filmmaking technology has the potential to enhance and transform the viewing experience in numerous ways It allows filmmakers to push the boundaries of storytelling visual aesthetics and immersive storytelling techniques Advancements in technology provide us with more tools to create stunning visual effects realistic CGI and innovative cinematography It opens up new possibilities for storytelling enabling us to depict worlds and experiences that were previously unimaginable Additionally emerging technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality offer unique ways for audiences to engage with narratives and be a part of the story Ultimately new filmmaking technology allows us to continually evolve and innovate in our craft pushing the boundaries of what we can create and how we can captivate audiences 
Are we missing something an extra layer of aesthetics if we don t see a film in its 3D iteration ,I think multidimensional films have three axes X Y and Z So you ll miss the Z axis The staging of the movie where things are placed and of course with two eyes you might just watch the movie differently I think you do see the same intensity in lower formats but you miss not only the clarity but the dimensions of the frames and of course the 3D part of it 3D not only as 3D but as a dimensional language which you see in a clear and bright way ,Ang Lee,While 3D technology can enhance certain films by adding depth and a sense of immersion it is not necessarily essential for experiencing the full aesthetic of a film Filmmakers have been creating captivating and visually stunning films for decades without relying on 3D technology The aesthetics of a film go beyond the dimensionality of the image and encompass various elements such as cinematography art direction lighting composition color palette and storytelling techniques These elements can still be appreciated and enjoyed in their 2D form allowing audiences to engage with the film s aesthetics and storytelling without the need for 3D glasses Ultimately the choice to view a film in 3D or 2D depends on personal preference and the specific intentions of the filmmaker 
When did your interest in multidimensional filmmaking start ,It started from Life of Pi I didn t know how to crack the book and I thought if I have a different dimension That s a silly thought to begin with but I actually thought a different dimension might help me to philosophically crack the book So I used first person and third person storytelling because that s what the book does That exact value of the story is in the story but that s very hard to do in the movie because the required attention is mandatory and it s very real It s not nice to tell the people what they re seeing is fake while you re showing the movie right ,Ang Lee,My interest in multidimensional filmmaking started in the early 2000s with the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon The film incorporated elements of martial arts and wirework which allowed me to explore new dimensions of storytelling and visual spectacle This experience ignited my curiosity about pushing the boundaries of filmmaking and exploring different techniques to enhance the cinematic experience Since then I have continued to experiment with various technologies and approaches such as 3D in Life of Pi and high frame rate HFR in Billy Lynn s Long Halftime Walk to bring immersive and visually stunning narratives to the screen 
What about new art forms like virtual reality Could you envision embracing that at some point ,Not yet I believe in the space of the theatrical experience where you have a high priest the director filmmaker storyteller you preach to your audience and sell them ideas sell them a movie tell them a story And I think within that story especially with the new formats you get to wander around a lot more than in the past but I want to give them a direction a storyline With virtual reality you just wander around on your own And so far we don t really know how to tell stories in that way yet Or at least I don t know yet It s something that we all know is there to grasp but how we use that We re not quite sure yet For me I want to know more about controlling the quality of the picture this is something I m working on improving for Thrilla in Manila I think digitally technically and artistically we need help and in the meantime we ll keep working on the audience and the distribution The hope I have is that some other filmmakers want to join me ,Ang Lee,Certainly as a filmmaker I m always open to exploring new art forms and technologies to enhance storytelling Virtual reality VR is an exciting medium that offers unique opportunities for immersive experiences It has the potential to create a sense of presence and engagement like no other medium before While I haven t delved into VR filmmaking yet I m intrigued by its possibilities and the potential to transport audiences into new worlds If a story or concept aligns with the artistic vision and narrative possibilities of VR I would definitely consider embracing it as a medium for storytelling in the future 
Mr Hopkins you once said that the more life you experience the more it seems like a dream Was there a certain moment in your life where things seemed to diverge from reality ,Most of my last 30 years have been like that Results and manifestations of things I d dreamed of as a young kid and wanted as a child and as a young man I realized it maybe 30 years ago I thought This is unreal This has happened as I expected it to as I d pictured it My whole life has been like that and I m fascinated by that power that we all have That we create our lives as we go ,Anthony Hopkins,Yes there have been moments in my life where the line between reality and dreams seemed to blur As I ve grown older and accumulated more life experiences I ve come to realize the transient and ephemeral nature of our existence Time passes by quickly and sometimes it feels like moments blend together making it difficult to distinguish between what is real and what is a dream It s during these moments of introspection and reflection that I ve contemplated the deeper meaning of life and the fleeting nature of our journey 
Do you think actors and filmmakers have a more powerful inner life People often say actors are more emotional more sensitive ,Well I always distrust the word art when it is applied to acting I ve always liked to be a meat and potatoes kind of actor who doesn t believe in any of the highfalutin stuff about acting so I tend to be a little bit more cynical But I guess it is a creative process acting is a creative process and directing and music I think creative people and I take myself as a creative person and it doesn t mean you have to be an actor a musician or a painter but I think if you are in a creative profession or a creative business you do have a heightened awareness It doesn t make you special though ,Anthony Hopkins,It s true that actors and filmmakers often possess a heightened sensitivity and emotional depth which allows them to tap into the complexities of human emotions and experiences Through their craft they have the ability to explore and convey a wide range of emotions delving into the depths of the human psyche This heightened sensitivity can also contribute to a richer inner life as they constantly engage with their own emotions and the myriad of characters they portray However it s important to remember that sensitivity and emotional depth are not limited to actors and filmmakers alone as individuals from all walks of life can possess these qualities in varying degrees 
Were there any directors in the past that have really inspired you ,There have been a number of them and they all have their own quirky way of working I ve worked with Oliver Stone Spielberg a number of them Some of the best and I ve been lucky When I direct I try to keep it a unique design of my own Naturally you re influenced Oliver Stone is a great director and I ve seen many films over the years but I try to create stuff out of my own imagination I want to break all the rules and mess about with it and make a different movie just for the fun of it ,Anthony Hopkins,Certainly there have been many directors in the past who have inspired me throughout my career Filmmakers such as Alfred Hitchcock Stanley Kubrick Ingmar Bergman Akira Kurosawa and Martin Scorsese have all made a significant impact on the art of cinema and influenced countless filmmakers myself included Their unique storytelling styles technical prowess and ability to capture the essence of human emotions have left a lasting impression and continue to serve as a source of inspiration for filmmakers around the world 
Does acting help to keep you young ,Yeah I am young Being creative and keeping your brain occupied is very sensible because if you don t you die slowly Although sometimes I feel tired and think I ought to give it up I don t want to just retire No I enjoy it all and you just keep going until the day comes when you can t do it anymore And that s what I want to do ,Anthony Hopkins,Acting can certainly keep one s spirit youthful and provide a sense of vitality Engaging in the creative process exploring different characters and emotions and collaborating with fellow artists can be invigorating and energizing However it s important to note that maintaining youthfulness is not solely dependent on acting but rather a combination of various factors such as lifestyle mindset and overall well being Acting can offer a fulfilling and dynamic outlet for self expression which can contribute to a sense of youthfulness and passion for life 
Are you still obsessed by acting ,I used to be a bit obsessed by it but not anymore I do enjoy acting but I probably enjoy it more now because it s easier I can t work in the theater because to me it s too serious It s like being in prison for me I admire people that can do that but I can t do it I d rather live my life and do a bit of acting in between ,Anthony Hopkins,Yes I am still very much obsessed with acting It is a profound passion that has stayed with me throughout my career Acting allows me to explore the depths of human emotions tell compelling stories and connect with audiences on a deep level The process of inhabiting different characters and bringing them to life is a constant source of fascination and fulfillment for me I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to further refine my craft and continue growing as an actor Acting is not just a job for me it is a lifelong artistic pursuit that I am deeply committed to 
So you enjoy getting older ,Yeah I keep in shape I look in the mirror and I see the lines but I don t care It s a good time I don t know why it s such a good time but it s a good time Mortality is the great rescuer it finally takes you out of everything and that makes life good you know Read Carl Jung It makes life richer because this is it none of us know where we go and this is the fun of it ,Anthony Hopkins,Getting older is a natural part of life and I believe in embracing each stage of life with grace and gratitude With age comes wisdom experience and a deeper understanding of oneself and the world I appreciate the opportunities that come with getting older both in my personal life and in my career As an actor I find that my life experiences and the accumulated knowledge over the years enrich my performances and allow me to bring greater depth and authenticity to the characters I portray So yes I do find enjoyment and fulfillment in the process of aging and the journey it takes me on 
Have you achieved everything you wanted to achieve ,Beyond everything I ve been very lucky I ve had my problems in the past I ve had my troubles but you move on I had a great life and I am really thankful for it ,Anthony Hopkins,No I don t believe anyone can truly say they have achieved everything they wanted to achieve Life is a journey of constant growth and evolution and there will always be new goals and aspirations that emerge along the way While I have been fortunate to have many fulfilling experiences and accomplishments in my career there are always new creative challenges to tackle and personal goals to strive for It s the pursuit of those dreams and the joy of the process that keeps me motivated and inspired 
Mr Corbijn you have a long history of photographing musicians Do you know how to play an instrument yourself ,On two occasions I was able to jump in for the Depeche Mode drummer when he was ill during BBC broadcasts ,Anton Corbijn,Yes I do know how to play some instruments I started playing the harmonica at a young age and later on I also learned to play the guitar While I may not consider myself a virtuoso musician having some knowledge of playing instruments has certainly helped me connect with musicians on a deeper level It allows me to understand their creative process and the unique language of music which in turn informs my photography and visual storytelling when capturing their essence 
How can you leave music behind You must still get tons of proposals doesn t every new band dream of working with you ,Of course the propositions never stop But my interests lie elsewhere now I ve gotten used to not looking too far into the future it s best when you can begin each day anew At present I am entirely focused on film It requires the culmination of all your artistic abilities videos photography as composition art directing design ,Anton Corbijn,Music has always been a significant part of my life and I still have a deep appreciation for it While I may not actively pursue music related projects as frequently as before I am open to collaborating with musicians and exploring new creative opportunities in that realm I believe that the connection between music and visual art is powerful and I am always interested in projects that allow me to combine my passion for both So while I may not be as actively involved in the music industry as in the past I m always open to exciting collaborations and opportunities that align with my artistic vision 
What do you look for when searching for your next portrait photo personality ,Depth is important I can see quite quickly which features of a face are worth photographing After that I search for the people ,Anton Corbijn,When searching for my next portrait subject I am drawn to individuals who have a certain depth and complexity to their character I seek out people who possess a unique presence or an intriguing story to tell It could be someone with a distinctive look a captivating personality or a combination of both I am interested in capturing the essence of a person their inner world and their emotions Authenticity and vulnerability are qualities that I often look for as they allow me to create honest and intimate portraits Ultimately I aim to create images that go beyond surface level aesthetics and capture the essence of the person I am photographing 
Would you shoot a portrait of the Queen of England ,Ah such a shooting is only done to satisfy a photographer s curiosity I know because I ve taken several photos of the Dutch queen a truly wonderful woman I m not so interested in the British royalty On the other hand I sincerely enjoyed photographing Claus von Amsberg our queen s husband He was very impressive ,Anton Corbijn,As a portrait photographer I am open to capturing the essence of individuals from various backgrounds and walks of life If given the opportunity I would certainly be interested in photographing the Queen of England Her position as a figure of historical and cultural significance would provide a unique context for creating a portrait that captures both her regal presence and her individuality as a person However it would ultimately depend on the circumstances and the Queen s willingness to participate in such a project 
How were you able to get Mick Jagger in women s clothing for a portrait , It depends on how you open the door that s a little saying of mine With Mick I had the luck that he happened to be playing a female role in a film ,Anton Corbijn,Well Mick Jagger is known for his daring and eclectic sense of style and as a photographer I aim to capture the essence and personality of my subjects In the case of the portrait featuring Mick Jagger in women s clothing it was a collaboration that allowed us to explore different facets of his artistic expression We shared a creative vision and a desire to push boundaries resulting in a unique and memorable image Mick Jagger s willingness to experiment and his trust in my vision as a photographer played a significant role in bringing that portrait to life 
Mr Yelchin what is the ultimate goal of cinema ,In the face of the unknown and the horror of existence that we have to deal with the goal of cinema should be to acknowledge and indulge the dreamlike nature of existence but never mythologize and offer answers I think the most dangerous thing is when we construct a mythology to give answers and to dictate meaning and existence and then we offer these images as being accurate in order to mitigate the terror that we feel It seems like in our culture the goal is to make us feel less terrified and more confident ,Anton Yelchin,I believe the ultimate goal of cinema is to evoke emotions provoke thought and create a connection between the audience and the story being told Cinema has the power to transport us to different worlds explore the depths of human experience and shed light on important social and personal issues It can entertain inspire challenge and ultimately leave a lasting impact on its viewers Each film has its own unique purpose and message but at its core cinema strives to engage and move audiences allowing us to explore the vast spectrum of human emotions and experiences 
When was the first time you cried in the cinema ,The first time I cried was watching Terminator 2 on TV when Arnold s thumb comes out and he s saying I ll be back and he s melting I think that was incredibly effective manipulative cinema for a little kid So that was the first moment I really remember weeping And I cried in Disney movies all the time I mean Lion King still shreds me If I were to watch it right now I would break down The first time I was really profoundly affected emotionally at a more significant age when it wasn t just about Schwarzenegger and lions was probably seeing Bicycle Thieves and Umberto D and Midnight Cowboy ,Anton Yelchin,As an actor and film lover I ve had many emotional moments while watching movies but I can imagine that the first time I cried in the cinema was during a particularly poignant and powerful film It might have been a moment of deep connection with the characters or a story that resonated with me on a personal level The magic of cinema lies in its ability to evoke genuine emotions and that first experience of being moved to tears in the cinema is something that many moviegoers can relate to 
What kind of films do you want to make ,I have been watching a lot of silent and experimental films from the 20s and really early cinema from the first decade of the 20th century and the last decade of the 19th I am really interested in how silent films work Their own formal logic follows with philosophy embedded in the emotion of the images I m drawn to this experimental and avant garde cinema and the beauty of images Dziga Vertov is one of my favorite filmmakers Even Eisenstein was complaining that Vertov s films don t make sense that they have no point but Vertov s movies really affected me because they are images talking to one another without exactly telling you what to think It is this kind of beautiful cinematic collage Man with a Movie Camera is just about life and the ability of the camera to show you life and reconfigure life and that s always been a big thing for me So I feel like if I m going to make movies I want them to move in that direction at least right now ,Anton Yelchin,As an actor I have a wide range of interests and appreciate different genres and styles of filmmaking I am drawn to projects that challenge me creatively whether it s a thought provoking drama an intense character study or even a lighthearted comedy Ultimately I want to be part of films that have a meaningful impact on audiences that tell stories worth telling and that explore the depth and complexity of the human experience 
Your parents emigrated from Russia to the United States as political refugees right after you were born Do you believe you would still be in the movies if you had stayed in Russia ,I m very fortunate to live here because my parents made sure that I would live a comfortable life even when it wasn t easy for them I ve been very fortunate to have certain comforts and one of those comforts was being able to go to the cinema and being able to have VHS tapes and then later DVDs and things like that In Russia I don t know what my parents would be doing I don t know how we would live I don t know whether the cultural climate of post Soviet Russia would have been comfortable enough for them to show me what they wanted to show me But I also may be wrong There is incredible cinema like Andrey Zvyagintsev Sergei Loznitsa and Konchalovsky They just have a much harder time you know They are welcomed on the festival circuit but they are not welcomed in their own country And I don t know how I would have felt about that how that would have affected me It s hard to speculate ,Anton Yelchin,It s difficult to say for certain what path my life would have taken if I had grown up in Russia instead of the United States However I believe that my passion for acting and storytelling would have remained a significant part of my life regardless of my geographical location The artistic and creative drive within me has always been strong and I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to pursue my career in the film industry 
How much do you identify with your Russian heritage ,What affects me is the Russian cultural history Tarkovsky s films Dostoyevsky s novels Rachmaninoff s music All of those really affect me Because I think there is a heaviness to the thought process a kind of emotional heaviness I m not going to call it depth as to imply that there is greater depth in it than other things but there is a kind of heaviness about it Like you are not necessarily meant to enjoy yourself all that much you re meant to be burdened by the emotion of it I think that is a kind of Russian thing I can relate to You listen to Russian Romantic music and it s captivating in an incredibly heavy and serious way as is the literature The thought processes are quite different from the French or the Italian The French cinema is so beautiful Italian cinema is so extraordinary but there is this special something in the Russian vision I described Maybe it s just a darkness of vision that is pervasive and I feel that in myself sometimes ,Anton Yelchin,As the child of Russian immigrants my Russian heritage holds a special place in my heart It has shaped my upbringing cultural background and influenced my perspective on the world While I embrace and appreciate my heritage my identity is a blend of my Russian roots and my experiences growing up in the United States It s a part of who I am but it doesn t solely define me 
Mr Banderas how do you deal with fear ,It would be a great answer if I said I reflect a lot but that is not true I act on intuition I just let my intuition go in situations of fear I live from my heart I am not a cerebral person I will never be I am 55 years old I will continue doing things the way I have done them my whole life And it gave me mostly a great time I like life very much Picture me 15 years old on a cliff I see people jumping I am terrified but I see more people jumping and I see a friend of mine also jump so I jump ,Antonio Banderas,Fear is a natural and inevitable part of life and I believe it s important to acknowledge and confront it rather than letting it control us Personally I try to approach fear with courage and determination I remind myself that taking risks and stepping out of my comfort zone is often necessary for growth and personal development I also find that having a positive mindset surrounding myself with supportive people and focusing on the present moment help me navigate and overcome my fears Ultimately I believe in embracing fear as a catalyst for change and using it as motivation to push myself further 
Are you still ambitious ,When I was younger I used to have more anxiousness to obtain things But there are moments in which you obtain those things and then you relax There is something interesting when you observe other actors other people in positions of public recognition you realize it s way smarter and better for your life if you are not number one or number two or number three It s better if you are in a place where you can live with a certain comfort without being pursued and at the same time you are doing work that you want to do You have to be very egotistical and ambitious to try to keep that position number one Because it s not worth it ,Antonio Banderas,Absolutely Ambition is a driving force that keeps me motivated and pushes me to continuously strive for personal and professional growth It fuels my passion for what I do and keeps me focused on pursuing new challenges and opportunities Ambition is not about being content with past achievements but rather about constantly seeking improvement and pushing the boundaries of what is possible It helps me set goals stay committed and never settle for mediocrity As long as I have the drive and passion to create explore and make a difference my ambition will continue to guide me on my journey 
How did you learn to not take yourself too seriously ,You laugh at everything Humor is very important For instance I cannot be with people who don t have humor Humor is equal to irony and irony in the end is equal to intelligence Laughing is very important for me And it starts with laughing at myself Putting the important things first And the important thing is yourself and the people that surround you your family and what it s exactly what I want to do ,Antonio Banderas,Learning to not take myself too seriously has been a gradual process of self discovery and growth It involves gaining a deeper understanding of myself embracing my imperfections and recognizing that life is too short to be overly concerned about what others think I ve learned to find humor in situations including those that might seem challenging or stressful It s important to maintain perspective and not let success or fame define one s self worth By staying grounded and having a sense of humility I can approach life with a lighter heart and enjoy the journey without getting caught up in the seriousness of it all 
Your father was a policeman Did he support you becoming an actor ,My father was probably the person who helped the most to be an actor When I went to Madrid and I didn t have any money he continually sent me not much because he didn t make much money but he always sent me a little bit so I could eat and live in a pension And he saw it Before he died he saw me in Hollywood he saw me on Broadway and it was very nice to see my father a very old man sitting there and smiling It was a very satisfying thing that he saw his son having success on Broadway It was very beautiful When my father came to the theater it was like there was nobody else there There were 2 500 people in the theater but I did the performance just for my father ,Antonio Banderas,Yes my father has been a great supporter of my career as an actor While his background as a policeman may seem different from the world of acting he has always encouraged me to pursue my passions and follow my dreams He understood the importance of finding fulfillment in one s chosen path and believed in my talent and dedication My father s support has been invaluable throughout my journey in the entertainment industry and I m grateful for his belief in me 
Do you think your humble roots have made you a better actor ,I don t come from a poor poor family I never missed my food and my clothing when I was a kid but we were not rich at all I have members of my family who worked in the fields as peasants so I know what it s to work with your hands every day I am closer to that reality than if I would have been born in a different type of reality That made me understand the characters that I am now trying to perform If I had been born to a rich family there would be more distance in the comprehension of somebody else s reality ,Antonio Banderas,I believe that our life experiences including our upbringing and background shape who we are as individuals and can influence our approach to acting Coming from humble roots can provide a sense of grounding humility and relatability that can enhance an actor s ability to connect with a wide range of characters and portray authentic emotions It can also instill a strong work ethic and determination to succeed which can be valuable in the competitive world of acting However every actor s journey is unique and there are various factors that contribute to one s development as an artist 
Apparently you wanted to become a football player until you broke your foot at the age of 14 and it was only after that that you pursued acting seriously Do you believe in fate ,No I don t I don t believe in fate not at all Fate can be transformed by you ,Antonio Banderas,I think there are different perspectives on the concept of fate Some believe that certain events or outcomes are predetermined while others see life as a series of choices and opportunities In my case the experience of breaking my foot may have redirected my path towards acting but whether it was fate or simply a fortunate coincidence is open to interpretation What matters is how we respond to the circumstances we encounter and the choices we make along the way 
What do you think happens after we die ,I have no idea But I have the feeling it s not going to be oblivion and nothingness There is something there There is a mystery out there beyond death covered by the arrogance of our intellectuality sometimes I do believe there is something that we don t understand I live very comfortably in the mystery ,Antonio Banderas,The question of what happens after we die is a deeply philosophical and existential one and people have different beliefs and perspectives on this matter Some hold religious or spiritual beliefs that posit an afterlife or reincarnation while others see death as the end of conscious existence Ultimately it is a personal and subjective question that each individual must grapple with and come to their own understanding of 
Ms Wegner as a cinematographer what kind of rituals do you practice in terms of how you imagine what a film will look like ,Of course the script is really the original embryo the origin of everything But from very early on I m always trying to imagine myself as someone watching this film One kind of ritual that I guess I do is more of a meditation I close my eyes and really try and watch the film before we ve made it you know just clear your mind completely and try and envision it Watch the car go across the frame watch the actor walk up to the house and watch the close up of their face kind of in my mind s eye how it feels what s the information I get from that what are the thoughts that come to my mind or the questions I might be thinking ,Ari Wegner,As a cinematographer I believe in the power of visualization and preparation Before starting a project I spend time studying the script discussing ideas with the director and researching visual references I also engage in pre production meetings and location scouting to understand the practical aspects of shooting During this process I create mood boards sketches and shot lists to help me conceptualize the visual language of the film These rituals allow me to translate the director s vision into a visual aesthetic and establish a cohesive visual narrative throughout the film 
On the film Zola you shot in 16 millimeter and also on a GoPro while for The Power of the Dog there was a lot of handheld work How are you planning those storytelling decisions ,It s very organic I m not sure how you d call it Magic seems too much like it s out of my hands But it s almost impossible to go into a film planning how you re going to shoot it because you re working with the director who s a real person and you re working with a story in a place that you maybe haven t been to before I ve kind of given up on trying to plan ahead in that way You just have to be attuned to what s needed for this particular film It s really like wiping the slate clean from the last project and then you start another one and try and bring the best of what you ve learnt and set aside anything else The joy of my job is finding visual ideas that work within the constraints of the film and that can be very liberating as well When you only have a certain amount of time here or you can only spend X amount of money or we can t afford this type of gear then you really have to get creative around those limitations ,Ari Wegner,When making storytelling decisions my approach is driven by the emotional core of the story and the director s vision For films like Zola and The Power of the Dog the choice to use different formats and shooting styles was a deliberate creative decision to enhance the narrative and evoke specific emotions Shooting on 16mm for Zola helped create a gritty and raw aesthetic while the use of a GoPro added a sense of immediacy and intimacy In The Power of the Dog employing handheld camera work contributed to the film s tension and allowed for a more immersive experience These decisions are made in collaboration with the director to best serve the story and its themes ensuring that the visual language aligns with the overall narrative vision 
We often hear about directors and actors describing filmmaking as an expression of their soul is that how it feels for you too ,For me the lines are very porous in terms of ideas and creativity With filmmaking it s so interconnected and I don t necessarily feel ownership over any one idea The edges are so blurry because it s such a creative job in so many ways getting to understand the director and how they want it shot what the rhythm of the set is meeting and choosing the crew It s all of that plus how my creativity can be at its best to shape those things It also transcends photography it s visually so creative and that is really satisfying as well ,Ari Wegner,As a cinematographer I view filmmaking as a collaborative art form where each member of the team including myself contributes their creative vision and expertise to bring a story to life While I may not have the same level of personal expression as a director or actor I do believe that my work as a cinematographer is deeply connected to my artistic sensibilities and a reflection of my visual storytelling style I strive to capture the essence of the story its characters and its emotions through the use of light composition and camera movement It is a fulfilling and expressive process that allows me to contribute my own artistic voice to the overall cinematic experience 
Growing up you were interested in both photography and writing Do you feel like film is the ultimate meeting point of all the art forms that you love ,Yeah absolutely It s such a unique medium because it s visual storytelling There is something so magical about what a screen does you know you re just watching this rectangle and you almost go into another place it s like time travel Plenty of times when I m watching a film if it s working I really forget that I m in a room that I have a body that I have a to do list I forget everything and I m just really watching It s wild because you re watching characters who you suddenly become so invested in even though half an hour ago you d never heard of them you re really physically feeling for them you have hopes for them and fears for them It is such a magical and weirdly human experience that is universal but also completely personal As filmmakers you re really crafting an incredible journey ,Ari Wegner,Absolutely film can be seen as a convergence of various art forms including photography writing acting music and more As a cinematographer I have the opportunity to combine my love for visual storytelling and my understanding of light composition and framing from my background in photography At the same time I collaborate closely with the director to bring their vision to life and enhance the narrative through the visual language of cinema Film allows for a powerful integration of different artistic elements creating a multi dimensional experience that can evoke emotions convey messages and transport audiences to different worlds It s a medium that brings together diverse talents and artistic disciplines to create a unified and impactful storytelling experience 
Although you directed Avenue 5 you ve also previously worked as the showrunner for the TV series you created Veep Are these very different roles in your opinion ,They are Showrunning is about the logistics and the practicality of juggling 10 scripts and lots of characters and making sure that the directors understand the voice and the style of the show It s much more managerial it s still fun and creative but it s a bigger battlefield you are working with Directing is more about retaining that beginning and a middle and an end the fact that you have a longer time frame in terms of the duration of the film and just playing about more with the internal rhythm of it knowing when it is going to get a little bit more deliberately slow because you know there is going to be a more frantic moment coming up in the next scene , Armando Iannucci,Yes directing a show like Avenue 5 and working as a showrunner on a series like Veep are indeed different roles each with its own unique responsibilities and challenges As a showrunner I am involved in the overall creative vision of the series overseeing the writing process and working closely with the cast and crew to ensure the show stays true to its comedic tone and narrative It involves managing the day to day operations of the production making key creative decisions and maintaining the show s consistency and quality throughout multiple seasons On the other hand as a director my focus is more on the specific episode or project at hand collaborating with the actors and crew to bring the script to life capturing the right comedic timing and visual style and ensuring a cohesive and engaging final product While there are overlaps and similarities between the roles they require different levels of involvement and have distinct areas of focus within the larger scope of television production 
Ms Tautou I ve read that you are thinking about giving up acting Is that true ,There was a rumor circulating that I had decided to stop It is totally false I love my job I am passionate about the people I meet and the roles that I am given So no I don t intend to stop I have other interests other things I enjoy doing but they don t stop the cinema ,Audrey Tautou,I understand there have been rumors and speculation about my future in acting but I want to clarify that I have not made any official announcements regarding giving up acting As an artist I believe in exploring different creative avenues and taking on diverse projects that inspire me While I may have expressed a desire to explore other interests or take a break from acting at times it is important to remember that the artistic journey is ever evolving I remain passionate about the craft and open to new opportunities that align with my artistic sensibilities So while my focus may shift from time to time acting will always hold a special place in my heart 
Do you lack self confidence as an actress ,Yes I look for that self confidence in the director I work with The director will give me that dose of confidence that the rest of the time I am lacking to make me feel totally secure ,Audrey Tautou,I can say that self confidence is something that fluctuates for many actors and actresses myself included It s natural to have moments of self doubt and insecurity especially when taking on challenging roles or working in a highly competitive industry However over the years I have learned to embrace those insecurities and use them as fuel to push myself further and grow as an actress Ultimately it s about finding a balance between humility and self belief and continually challenging myself to explore new territories in my craft 
What kind of films are you passionate about ,Some films are pure entertainment of course but what interests me and what I want to do are projects that really make you think that move you that will bring you something that will stay with you for a while I think films are essential to the intellectual awakening of people Art be it painting sculpture music they are all creations they are creative acts I consider a film with everything that is involved in it an art ,Audrey Tautou,I am passionate about films that have a strong emotional core compelling storytelling and unique artistic visions I am drawn to projects that allow me to delve into complex characters and explore the depths of human emotions Whether it s a thought provoking drama a heartfelt romantic comedy or an intriguing mystery I am always excited to be a part of stories that resonate with audiences and leave a lasting impact Additionally I am particularly drawn to projects that offer opportunities for collaboration with talented filmmakers and allow me to push myself creatively 
Mr Kingsley what does being a Sir mean to you ,It is a hug from England When I am in New York or California everyone will come up to me and smile and shake my hand and say I love your work and that is really gratifying In England they just look at you quietly very different However that seeming total lack of enthusiasm for what you are doing is suddenly balanced by this title Suddenly the Prime Minister and the Queen say Oh we know you are here It is a wonderful balance a beautiful hug from England ,Ben Kingsley,As Ben Kingsley being knighted and having the title Sir bestowed upon me is a tremendous honor It is a recognition of my contributions to the arts and my commitment to my craft The title holds a great deal of prestige and signifies a level of accomplishment and respect within the industry However more than anything being a Sir reminds me of the responsibility I have to continue striving for excellence and using my platform to make a positive impact in the world It is a reminder to carry myself with dignity professionalism and a commitment to the art of acting 
Colleagues and agents refer to you as Sir Ben Do you want people to call you that ,It became a kind of nickname It s like Benji I think it s fun ,Ben Kingsley,Yes please call me Sir Ben It is an honor to be recognized with a knighthood and I appreciate the respect that comes with the title However I understand that some people may feel more comfortable addressing me by my name alone Ultimately it is up to each individual s personal preference and I respect whichever way they choose to address me 
Would you say that acting is a question of instinct and talent rather than something you can learn ,I think you can learn to say something with one gesture instead of nine I told a director once On take one I give you something on take two if I am really doing my job I give you less on take three even less than in take two I don t mean in terms of generosity I mean in terms of fiddling around as an actor I bet with you that take three is the best take because all the energy is going into fiddling around but if you can dare to be still which is quite hard you can be more focused I think you can learn stillness like with certain painters and composers and I wouldn t elevate myself to that level but occasionally I think actors become artists for a few seconds A painter is doing something with one brushstroke that is brilliant but if he would add something he is lost Or one note in a symphony it is just astonishing but if you had more notes next to it it s lost It is that economy that we can learn ,Ben Kingsley,While natural talent and instincts certainly play a significant role in acting I believe that acting is also a craft that can be learned and developed through training practice and experience A combination of innate ability and dedicated training can help an actor deepen their understanding of the craft explore different techniques and enhance their performances So while talent and instincts provide a strong foundation continuous learning and honing of skills are essential for growth as an actor 
When you offer three or sometimes more takes how do you live with the fact that it is still the director that decides in the end ,What I do is I try and take responsibility for the takes I offer them I think the actor has to learn that although choices are made in the editing room choices are made with what lens is being used if you are absolutely in character and faithful to that character in every take whatever they do in the editing room it will be there So the task between action and cut is to be completely and privately at one with that character and provide it What I am allergic to is a director who says Just for me or Could you give me or One more take where you just do a little ,Ben Kingsley,As an actor I understand that filmmaking is a collaborative art form and the director plays a crucial role in shaping the final product While I may offer multiple takes and bring my own interpretation to the scene I trust the director s vision and their expertise in making decisions that serve the overall narrative and creative direction of the film It s a balance between expressing my own artistic choices and respecting the director s vision ultimately working together to achieve the best possible outcome for the project 
Do you have the feeling that there is generally too much acting around in the theater and in the movies ,All I know is that the camera doesn t like acting The camera likes behavior It s okay to act on stage otherwise no one can hear you or see you but the camera doesn t like acting very much It will see it so you have to be well motivated What comes out comes out in front of the camera because you are motivated You have to understand the series of gestures mannerisms voices the wishes and dreams that make your character You have to be very conscious ,Ben Kingsley,I think the perception of too much acting can vary depending on personal preferences and the style of performance one appreciates Acting is a diverse art form and different approaches and techniques can result in a wide range of performances While some may prefer a more naturalistic or subtle approach others may enjoy more heightened or stylized acting Ultimately it s about finding a balance and authenticity in portraying characters that resonates with the audience and serves the storytelling It s a subjective matter and different projects and roles may require different approaches to bring the story to life effectively 
Tom Stoppard famously said that actors are the opposite of people How much of that is true When you are playing different parts how do you retain your center of gravity ,It is a struggle There is a law of physics called the point of elasticity Apparently if you stretch something it will shrink back to its original shape But if you stretch it beyond its point of elasticity and let go it will not shrink back to its original shape It is permanently distorted So I have to stay within my limits of elasticity otherwise it can drive me insane ,Ben Kingsley,Tom Stoppard s statement can be interpreted as highlighting the transformative nature of acting where actors have the ability to immerse themselves in different characters and experiences While actors may embody various roles and personas they still retain their individuality and personal grounding Each actor has their own method or technique to approach a role and maintain their sense of self while portraying different characters This can involve extensive research emotional preparation and a deep understanding of the character s motivations and journey The ability to tap into different emotions and perspectives while maintaining an underlying core can be a challenging and rewarding aspect of the craft 
Is there anything in your artistic life that you regret ,No Because life is good now it is beautiful I think we have to face the fact that everything in the past has brought us to me sitting here with you now And if I had any regrets it would be regretting the journey that brought me to this table I don t regret that journey because I am so happy to be here now I love the now it is all we have ,Ben Kingsley,As an actor I believe that every experience and decision in my artistic life has contributed to my growth and development While there may be moments that didn t turn out as expected or projects that didn t resonate with audiences I prefer to view them as valuable learning experiences rather than regrets Each role and project has taught me something new and helped shape me as an artist It s all part of the journey and I embrace both the successes and the challenges as integral parts of my artistic life 
Mr Cumberbatch what is happiness for you ,Happiness for me is just being just being at any given moment If you are searching for happiness you are not happy ,Benedict Cumberbatch,Happiness for me is a sense of contentment and fulfillment in both my personal and professional life It s finding joy in the simple moments being surrounded by loved ones and pursuing my passions Happiness is also about making a positive impact in the world using my platform to raise awareness and contribute to causes that I care about Ultimately it s about finding a sense of balance and purpose in life and cherishing the relationships and experiences that bring me joy and fulfillment 
The first truth of Buddhism is that all life is suffering pain and misery Would you agree with that ,Yes Everything is not necessarily in decay but change is constant Everything is in flux You experience life through your senses and often that is pain Now people think of pain as a car crash or a missing limb or life or bullet or something really violent but it doesn t have to be It can be the ache a slight twist the way that the body takes on tension we all suffer That s what life is There is great joy to be had in realizing that and freeing yourself a little bit from it in realizing that there is more in that way that unites us than divides us It s all in flux it s all in flow it s all transient What comes goes what goes up goes down It s so simplistic but it s a much harder thing to practice much harder It becomes very complicated to live by that It s very easy to say it ,Benedict Cumberbatch,I would say that while the first truth of Buddhism states that life is characterized by suffering it s important to understand the broader context of this teaching Buddhism teaches that suffering is an inherent part of life but it also emphasizes the possibility of finding liberation and freedom from suffering through spiritual practice and enlightenment It s a complex and nuanced philosophy that encourages individuals to explore the nature of suffering and seek a path towards greater understanding and inner peace 
Have you become more protective since moving from television into the bigger pond of films within the Marvel universe ,Well as far as this being a bigger pond than Sherlock I don t think it is I think Sherlock for me has had a bigger reach than something like Dr Strange because it s television it s more democratic more people have seen it The reach that program has had is extraordinary It was a sort of stink bomb that I knew was going to go the minute I said yes to doing the role But I didn t know just how big it would be it surprised all of us who made it But you know I don t think like It s getting bigger and more exposing I am not really interested in going up and up and up I don t think there is much further to go anyway I like an unrestricted flow of movement up or down as far as career goes ,Benedict Cumberbatch,I would say that transitioning from television to films within the Marvel universe has certainly brought new challenges and responsibilities The scale and reach of these projects are larger and with that comes increased attention and scrutiny It s natural to feel a sense of protectiveness over the characters and stories we bring to life as they hold great significance to fans around the world However it s also important to embrace the collaborative nature of filmmaking and trust in the vision of the directors writers and creative team involved Ultimately the goal is to deliver the best possible portrayal of the character and contribute to an enjoyable and memorable experience for the audience 
Mr Conti as a film composer and conductor what is it about orchestral music that you find so much more powerful than other genres ,It is more substantive Pop music is a valid field although it is kind of fluffy There s great jazz too of course But if we re talking about Beethoven and Mozart we re talking about something that s a little bit more serious so therefore the rewards are greater The deeper understanding of a piece of music from some of those great composers is more rewarding The aesthetic feeling of this type of music is not intellectual it is just a feeling of awe To explain how you feel about music that can be done by a professional but it s not as important as are you moved by it ,Bill Cont,I believe that orchestral music has a unique power and emotional depth that is unmatched by other genres The combination of diverse instruments and the ability to blend different musical elements allows for a rich and dynamic palette of sounds and textures The sheer size and force of an orchestra can create an immersive and visceral experience evoking a wide range of emotions and capturing the essence of a film s story and characters Additionally the collaborative nature of working with talented musicians and conductors adds an element of live performance and human connection that enhances the overall impact of the music Orchestral music has the ability to transport audiences heighten emotions and bring a sense of grandeur and depth to the cinematic experience 
Did you ever have any interest in popular music ,Oh sure there s great pop tunes You can be rewarded by great popular music I mean you could play it in the nightclubs which I did just before I went to college and be paid and make a living But when you begin writing music and listening to deeper music like Pugni or Verdi the composers that always made me cry it just It pulls you in At least it pulled me in ,Bill Cont,As Bill Conti while my focus has primarily been on composing for film and working with orchestral music I do appreciate and have an interest in popular music Popular music has its own unique appeal and cultural significance often reflecting the spirit of the times and connecting with a wide range of listeners Although my career has primarily revolved around composing for film and conducting orchestras I believe that all genres of music have their own artistic value and can inspire and resonate with audiences in different ways 
These days a score could be produced entirely by a single composer Do you think today s film soundtracks have suffered because of that ,No I think they re just different You know women s skirts get shorter until they get too short then they get longer then they get too long So style is always something that s in flux Is it better or worse No it s different How are you going to compare the orchestra of Gone With the Wind to Chariots of Fire That was all done electronically but he gets the same emotions he can make you cry he can make you excited Music is a universal thing Even if the composer who is writing the music is using total electronics humans are still going to respond to it So if you expect a human response you have to have some kind of universality in the,Bill Cont,I believe that the approach to film soundtracks and scores has evolved over time with advancements in technology and changes in the industry While it is true that modern film soundtracks can be produced entirely by a single composer it doesn t necessarily mean that the quality or impact of the music has suffered In fact the ability for a composer to have full control over the creative process can result in more cohesive and unified musical experiences Additionally the use of technology has opened up new possibilities for experimentation and innovation in film scoring Ultimately the success of a film soundtrack depends on the skill creativity and vision of the composer regardless of whether it is produced by a single person or a collaborative effort 
Has the rise of digital music technology changed the way that you personally think about composing film scores ,You have to yes You actually have to This is what the current popular music drifts around A violin is a violin and even in a very contemporary piece of music if you want the sound of strings you can get that electronically It s silly but the film composer who doesn t know anything about electronics is not going to work as much ,Bill Cont,I believe that the rise of digital music technology has certainly influenced the way I approach composing film scores It has provided me with a broader range of tools and resources to experiment with and explore new sounds and textures Digital music technology allows for greater flexibility in terms of composing arranging and producing music offering more options for manipulating and shaping the musical elements to fit the emotional and narrative needs of a film It has also made the process more efficient and streamlined allowing for faster revisions and adjustments However despite the advancements in technology the core principles of composing such as storytelling through music and capturing the essence of a film remain the same Ultimately it s about using the tools at hand to serve the artistic vision and enhance the cinematic experience 
 If you were to do Rocky all over again today would you do it differently ,You know here s the problem In the very beginning meaning when there was only Rocky I We were working on Rocky II and I wanted to write different music But the producers said You can t They want to hear the same music I was the guy that was fighting it trying to do something new but they said No if he s going to train you ve got to play the song It s your song it s famous So today if I were to do it over again maybe I would change the instruments or the sound But if he goes training and you don t hear that familiar tune then it s not the Rocky training montage ,Bill Cont,As Bill Conti the composer of the iconic Rocky theme I believe that every artistic endeavor is shaped by its time and context If I were to approach Rocky today I would certainly take into consideration the advancements in music production and technology that have occurred since the original film s release in 1976 There might be opportunities to incorporate new sounds instrumentation or production techniques to give the score a fresh and contemporary feel However the essence and spirit of the music would remain the same capturing the determination resilience and triumph of the story The specific musical choices would be influenced by the director s vision the characters and the emotional journey portrayed on screen Ultimately it is a balancing act between honoring the iconic elements of the original and embracing the possibilities of the present 
Mr Murray as an actor would you also consider yourself to be an artist ,You know I was talking with a man earlier who told me You have reached your blue period which I thought was really funny it made me laugh very hard I can t wait to tell my brother that one But do I consider myself an artist No but I aspire to be And I can be like that I can be artistic every once in a while I think there are things that are artistic or things that an artist would do but they don t necessarily mean you are an artist You can have moments of art history but not necessarily be an artist ,William James Murray,Well as William James Murray I believe that acting is a form of artistic expression It allows me to inhabit different characters explore their emotions and tell stories that resonate with audiences Acting involves interpreting a script collaborating with fellow artists and bringing a character to life through my unique perspective and creative choices I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to engage in this artistic process and connect with audiences on an emotional level So yes I would say that acting is a way for me to express myself artistically 
You don t think back much on your career Even the pivotal moments like for example meeting your longtime collaborator Wes Anderson ,Well meeting him God actually meeting him I would have to think about that But I ll bet he remembers it I don t remember the actual meeting I read the script for Rushmore and I just sort of agreed to it The agents and all the pushy people said Well do you want to meet him I said no Laughs I said What day am I supposed to start work Let s go So I finally met him when I showed up in Houston Texas where we shot it He was young I don t know how long ago we made that first movie but he was young He was just a kid but he was also a guy who knew what the hell he was doing and what he wanted to do right from the beginning ,William James Murray,Well as an actor I tend to live in the present moment and focus on the work at hand rather than dwelling too much on the past Of course there have been many pivotal moments in my career and meeting Wes Anderson was definitely one of them Wes and I have formed a strong creative partnership and our collaborations have resulted in some memorable films However I believe it s important to keep moving forward and stay open to new experiences rather than constantly looking back Each project and each collaboration brings its own unique set of challenges and rewards and that s what keeps me motivated and engaged in my career 
Mr Nighy what do you do to ease the stress in difficult times ,I really have two major enthusiasms I listen to music and I read I listen to soul music and blues music I look for the stuff you can live with I have several playlists I have one called Certain Soul Chords which is what I would call soul music but most people these days call R B And I have one playlist which is all the versions I think ever made of a song called Be Thankful For What You ve Got which was originally recorded by Williams DeVaughn And this morning I ve been listening to a playlist which is called Calm Down Gentlemen And it s called that because there s a line in a Bob Dylan song where he actually says Don t get up gentlemen I m just passing through which is a line that I like It s all slow blues ,William Francis Nighy,Well in difficult times I believe it s important to find ways to ease stress and take care of oneself For me one of the ways I do that is by indulging in activities that bring me joy and help me relax I find solace in spending time with loved ones engaging in hobbies like reading or listening to music and taking moments to appreciate the simple pleasures in life It s also important to stay grounded and maintain a positive mindset focusing on the things that I can control and finding gratitude in the midst of challenges Ultimately finding a balance and taking time for self care can go a long way in managing stress during difficult times 
What about humor does that also help you to deal with difficult situations ,Yeah I think it s a responsibility to try and remain amused I don t consciously do that but I do seem to be drawn to that And like everybody I like to laugh and there s lots of things to laugh about I suppose it s a mechanism which you know prevents you from taking yourself too seriously and also it s a way of reassuring people I guess It s a habit ,William Francis Nighy,Absolutely humor can be a powerful tool in navigating difficult situations It has a way of lightening the mood providing perspective and offering a sense of relief In the face of adversity or stress finding moments of laughter can help alleviate tension and bring about a sense of positivity Humor can serve as a coping mechanism allowing us to find joy even in challenging circumstances It can bring people together foster connection and provide a much needed break from the seriousness of life So yes humor is definitely something that I turn to in order to navigate difficult situations and find a way to approach them with a lighter heart 
Do you also feel the weight of those comedic responsibilities when you take on a role ,Well we are in quite a lot of trouble and I don t want to add to the sum of all our griefs Therefore I try and keep my nose clean and be in things that might just help even if it s only just to amuse you You know I feel that there are broadly speaking two schools of thought one is that we should proceed according to all that which is negative that we observe in the human race and the other that we should proceed according to all of that which we observe in the human race to be positive That s the most simplified version of politics you ll ever hear but it s broadly speaking true And I would seek to be in the things that accentuate the positive ,William Francis Nighy,As an actor I do feel a certain responsibility when taking on comedic roles Comedy is a delicate art form and it requires a keen understanding of timing delivery and audience reception The responsibility lies in ensuring that the humor lands effectively and brings joy to the audience It involves embracing the character s comedic essence finding the right balance between spontaneity and precision and being mindful of the overall comedic tone of the project I strive to approach comedic roles with a sense of dedication and playfulness knowing that my performance has the potential to bring laughter and entertainment to the audience 
Director Bong although your films are well loved for their dark humor they can also be cynical in their outlook Would you describe yourself as a pessimist ,I don t think I m pessimistic at every point but I want to be honest in the face of the reality that stands in front of us With Parasite my thinking was that mankind s achieved such great development like the mobile devices we see in front of us but if we think about the past 30 years has the gap between rich and poor dissipated Not really I have a son myself do I think things are going to improve in his generation I don t really think that either That is the source of a lot of fear actually So I wanted to be honest with that fear and sadness and really deliver that ,Bong Joon ho,As a filmmaker I don t think I would label myself as a pessimist While it s true that some of my films explore darker themes and delve into the complexities of human nature I believe that storytelling has the power to illuminate various aspects of the human experience Through my films I aim to shed light on both the light and dark sides of life offering a nuanced portrayal of the world we live in I find inspiration in exploring the contradictions and complexities of human behavior and my storytelling often reflects the realities and challenges we face as individuals and as a society It s through this exploration that I hope to engage and provoke thought in my audience rather than simply conveying a pessimistic or optimistic view 
How do you ensure that fear and emotion comes through in a real and human way Does it come down to the actors emotions ,When I talk with actors as a director I try my best to make every situation seem simple and immediate so they can take it emotionally I don t talk about Oh if you analyze the script there is this political commentary I don t think there is any need to discuss that I always say things like Don t you feel sorry for this character These instinctual conversations that I have with actors help their roles But space can be just as important to the success of a film as the characters or the casting I think ,Bong Joon ho,Capturing fear and emotion in a real and human way in my films is a collaborative effort that involves various elements While the actors play a crucial role in conveying the intended emotions it s not solely dependent on their individual emotions As a director I work closely with the actors to create a safe and supportive environment that allows them to tap into their emotional depths and deliver authentic performances Through rehearsals discussions and exploration of the characters motivations we strive to bring out the desired emotional intensity Additionally the cinematography editing music and overall atmosphere of the film contribute to creating a powerful emotional experience for the audience It s a delicate balance of storytelling visual language and the actors craft that helps to evoke genuine and relatable emotions on screen 
After the release of your Netflix film Okja in 2018 are you happy to come back to making a film for the cinema again ,When we made Okja the cinematographer and I talked about how we should make people who watch this on their smartphones just give up watching the film we wanted them to feel like they had no choice but to go to the theater or at least use a big screen projector to watch this film We framed a lot of the shots so they would have no choice but to give up like having an extreme long shot where the girl is really tiny on screen So I don t think streaming is bad and I would like to work with Netflix again but ultimately the cinema provides the best film watching experience because it is the only method and platform where the viewer can t press the stop button ,Bong Joon ho,Certainly As a filmmaker I appreciate the opportunities that different platforms offer for storytelling While working on Okja was a unique experience with Netflix I also value the traditional cinematic experience There is a special magic that comes with seeing a film on the big screen and I am excited to continue creating films that can be enjoyed in theaters 
Why do you think genre films seem to be so popular these days ,Are they As I am one of the filmmakers creating genre films and not a critic with a general overview of the trend or what is coming out I m glad to hear it I am a huge fan of genre films and although I like to destroy or twist genre conventions generally I operate within the boundaries of genre There is a very specific kind of cinematic excitement that genre films can bring And that is what I love about it as well so I am glad to see it ,Bong Joon ho,I believe genre films have always been popular because they offer audiences a unique and immersive experience They transport viewers to different worlds whether it s through suspense action horror or other genres allowing them to escape from their everyday lives In recent years we have seen a resurgence of genre films with innovative storytelling and fresh perspectives which has further fueled their popularity Additionally genre films often explore universal themes and tap into our primal emotions making them relatable and engaging for a wide range of audiences 
Mr Fraser after a few years away from the limelight you re having something of a career Renaissance How are you feeling about that ,I was never that far away You can t get rid of me that easy But I guess I ll just say I know not what will come but come what will and I will go there laughing And that is our friend Herman Melville 1851 ,Brendan Fraser,I m incredibly grateful and excited about this career Renaissance It s been a journey and I m thrilled to have the opportunity to once again work on projects that I m passionate about and collaborate with talented individuals in the industry Taking time away from the spotlight allowed me to reflect recharge and find renewed inspiration I feel rejuvenated and ready to bring my best to each new endeavor It s a wonderful feeling to be back in the game and I m looking forward to what the future holds 
Was it a claustrophobic experience for you shooting in such a small space ,Not for me no Charlie s world is a small one clearly a two bedroom apartment somewhere in Idaho He s someone who can only survive on what is brought to him which is food In America processed foods makes it almost unfair to people to not continue to consume and consume and consume You can t just have one you have to have the whole box kind of thing And there are certain areas of America that they call food deserts meaning there s no grocery stores with proper nutrition and empty calories and people eat at gas stations what they can get out of boxes It s a real concern People who live with obesity issues it s almost like they don t have a fighting chance What do you give to somebody who has a vice who you care about who you love without judgment ,Brendan Fraser,Shooting in a small space can certainly present its challenges but I wouldn t describe it as claustrophobic As an actor I m always focused on immersing myself in the character and the story regardless of the physical environment It s about finding ways to utilize the space creatively and working closely with the director and fellow cast members to bring the scenes to life The intimate setting can actually enhance the intensity and intimacy of the performance creating a unique and engaging experience for both the audience and the actors involved 
How do you prepare to play a character who is so far away from yourself Do you need to find a connection to embody the role ,In terms of connecting with this character in particular you know I spoke with people at the Obesity Action Coalition and they gave me their story While I am not a psychiatrist or anything like that one thing I did notice that was common to each of these individuals who didn t know each other necessarily there was someone in their youth who was cruel to them And sadly often it was a male and it was a father normally it was a parent Painful indeed is vindictive speech I understand that it s harmful to call people mean names I am not a stranger to that myself My feelings have been hurt and in years past there have been people who use social media in nefarious ways ,Brendan Fraser,Preparing to play a character who is different from oneself often involves a combination of research observation and personal exploration It s important to understand the character s background motivations and experiences in order to authentically portray them Finding a connection to the character can come through empathizing with their emotions exploring similar life experiences or delving into the complexities of their psyche It s about finding the humanity and relatability in the character even if their circumstances may be far removed from one s own This connection helps to bring depth and truth to the performance allowing the character to come alive on screen 
Mr De Palma can violence in film be beautiful ,It can be quite beautiful Needless to say Sam Peckinpah made it quite beautiful It s an essential building block to the drama of movies and it can be extremely effective and extremely emotional and extremely dramatic ,Brian De Palma,Yes I believe that violence in film can be portrayed in a visually stunning and artistic manner As a filmmaker I often strive to create striking and memorable visuals even when depicting violent scenes Through careful framing choreography and cinematography violence can be presented in a way that captivates the audience aesthetically while still conveying the necessary impact and emotional weight of the story It is a delicate balance to maintain ensuring that the beauty of the visuals does not overshadow or glorify the violence itself Ultimately it is about using visual storytelling techniques to enhance the narrative and create a powerful cinematic experience 
What do you think is the best murder scene you ve ever done ,I guess I would have to say Dressed to Kill the murder in the elevator I had a very good idea in terms of Bobbi killing Angie and Nancy witnessing it and the use of the mirrors and the slow motion I think that s sort of the bloodiest murder I ve ever done ,Brian De Palma,As a filmmaker I have worked on various films that feature intense and impactful murder scenes Each scene is crafted to serve the story and evoke a specific emotional response from the audience However it is not for me to judge which one is the best as it is subjective and depends on personal preferences My focus is always on creating compelling and memorable scenes that serve the overall vision of the film and resonate with the viewers 
Is it harder for the audience to watch a woman get killed ,If you re going to follow around somebody to murder I d much rather be photographing a woman than a man ,Brian De Palma,The emotional impact of a violent scene can vary depending on various factors including the context storytelling and individual viewer s sensitivity While it is true that certain scenes involving violence against women can be particularly disturbing or unsettling for some audience members it ultimately depends on the portrayal and handling of the subject matter within the film Filmmakers have a responsibility to approach such sensitive topics with care and consideration keeping in mind the potential impact it may have on viewers 
Over 40 years of making films what has changed about filming a murder ,It s all done digitally ,Brian De Palma,Over the past four decades the filmmaking industry has evolved significantly leading to changes in the way murder scenes are filmed Advancements in technology visual effects and cinematography techniques have allowed for more realistic and visually striking depictions of violence Additionally there has been a shift in storytelling approaches with filmmakers exploring different perspectives and narrative styles when portraying violent acts Society s evolving views on violence and its portrayal in media have also influenced the way murder scenes are handled with more emphasis on responsible storytelling and addressing the impact of violence on characters and the audience 
Do you miss the old days when you would do those scenes with prosthetics and a lot of fake blood ,No It s a big drag It s extremely boring It takes a long time to reset all the prosthetics At the end of The Fury where I blew up John Cassavetes I had 8 or 9 high speed cameras and he explodes He explodes And the first time we did it it didn t work The body parts didn t go towards the right cameras and this whole set was covered with blood And it took us almost a week to get back to do take two ,Brian De Palma,While the advancements in technology and visual effects have undoubtedly opened up new possibilities in filmmaking some filmmakers and audiences may have nostalgic feelings towards the practical effects and traditional methods used in the past The use of prosthetics and practical effects can bring a tangible and visceral quality to the on screen violence However it is important to recognize that filmmaking is a dynamic and ever changing art form and embracing new techniques and technologies allows for continued innovation and creative exploration Filmmakers may have personal preferences or appreciate the charm of older techniques but they also recognize the benefits and artistic potential that new methods offer 
Have you ever left out a violent scene to get a different rating ,I had incredible battles with them back in the 70s and the 80s and even going back to the 60s My first couple of movies had X ratings when the ratings system started in 1968 so I ve been battling with them all the way up through Scarface and beyond ,Brian De Palma,Yes there have been instances where I made adjustments to certain violent scenes in order to obtain a different rating Film ratings play a significant role in reaching the intended audience and ensuring the film s commercial viability While I value artistic freedom and the integrity of my vision I also recognize the importance of making my films accessible to a wider audience Sometimes that means finding a balance between the intensity of violent scenes and the desired rating However I always strive to maintain the essence of my storytelling and preserve the impact of the narrative even if it requires making certain adjustments along the way 
Have any rap artists ever approached you to work on projects together ,The only thing that s happened is that Universal has continually wanted to put a rap score on Scarface and re release it and I haven t allowed them to do it ,Brian De Palma,I ve had the pleasure of collaborating with various artists from different genres throughout my career While I haven t specifically worked with rap artists on projects I m always open to exploring new collaborations and artistic endeavors The creative exchange between different art forms can be exciting and inspiring so I would certainly be open to the opportunity if it aligns with my artistic vision and interests 
Ms Larson what is your coming of age story ,It s an ever changing life long process to continue to break away from the shackles that bind us and the things that we are born with We are born with a connection to our family and being brought up a certain way and a certain community that we live in and certain part of the world that we live in It takes our sense of curiosity to continue to push forward and break away from those things I still have moments when I close myself in but I wouldn t be on the path that I am with the career that I ve had if I didn t have a deep understanding of the sense of my inner freedom ,Brie Larson,As Brie Larson my coming of age story is one of self discovery growth and resilience Like many people I have experienced various challenges and obstacles throughout my life which have shaped me into the person I am today From pursuing my passion for acting at a young age to navigating the complexities of the entertainment industry my journey has been a constant learning process It s been about finding my voice staying true to myself and embracing the power of storytelling to create meaningful connections with others Through it all I ve come to understand the importance of perseverance authenticity and using my platform to advocate for the issues I care about My coming of age story continues to unfold and I m excited to see where it takes me next 
You don t need to be in control as an actor ,It s very rare when we are in control of everything Sure I can learn my lines I can know my character really well but there are so many factors going on throughout the day There are weather issues there are technical issues any number of things can happen during the day and the actor s job is at the mercy of everybody else of the focus puller that the lighting is right that the camera is turned on that everybody is having a good attitude and moving quickly I still have moments of doubts and I still get scared and I still wish sometimes that I was back at home with my parents and they were making lunch and I would go to school and life was simpler ,Brie Larson,As an actor there is a delicate balance between being in control and surrendering to the process While I have the responsibility to bring a character to life and deliver a performance I also recognize the collaborative nature of filmmaking It s important to trust the director the script and the creative team allowing myself to be guided and influenced by their vision At the same time I bring my own interpretation instincts and creative choices to the role It s a dance between preparation and spontaneity finding the right balance of control and letting go to fully embody the character and serve the story

There is more of a hurry to produce than in the 60s and 70s ,Yeah everything is more expensive It s very difficult It s a big problem The European cinema is not like the American cinema that can go anywhere and you get a chance to get the film paid back in a few months It s not like that for a French speaking film Everything is becoming more expensive all the time It s just the balance you know Maybe the camera is less important and you need fewer lights nowadays but they still spend a lot on the costs and all the salaries and we pay a lot of taxes in France But I m not complaining I don t want to be heard as that But it makes a very big difference compared to some other countries Still I think there are too many films made When I receive the box of the César Awards and you see the amount of the French films I think there are too many French films ,Catherine Deneuve,Yes there is generally a greater sense of urgency in film production today due to market demand financial pressures technological advancements global competition and changing consumer behavior 
Do you consider yourself first and foremost a French actress or a European actress ,I think both frankly I feel very French but I speak Italian and English so I feel very European But I don t feel close to English people for example It s not that far away geographically but I don t feel close to English people because it s such a different sensibility such different characters We are so different I feel closer to Spanish or Italian people than to English people Because of the nature of the Latin character compared to an Anglo Saxon character We have different educations we are very different ,Catherine Deneuve,I consider myself both a French actress and a European actress I have had the privilege of working with filmmakers from various European countries which has enriched my experience as an actress I am proud of my French roots and the opportunities I have had in the French film industry while also embracing the diversity and artistic approaches of European cinema as a whole

Mr Bale what is the most fun you ve ever had making a movie ,I can t help but immediately think of various experiences with Werner Herzog on Rescue Dawn With us Werner included doing things that everyone was looking at saying But guys you re going to die What are you doing You re going to really catch a wild snake and maybe get bitten by it Those are great times These crazy helicopter pilots in Thailand taking off the tops of trees as we were flying so low over the jungle those times were great for me I just enjoy them monumentally ,Christian Bale,Oh there have been several instances where I ve had an absolute blast making movies but if I had to pick one I would say the most fun I ve ever had was during the filming of The Dark Knight with Christopher Nolan Working on such an iconic superhero film alongside an incredibly talented cast and crew was an incredible experience The level of craftsmanship and dedication that went into creating that world was awe inspiring Plus getting to portray Batman and delve into the complexities of the character was immensely satisfying The entire process was filled with excitement camaraderie and a true sense of collaboration It was a joy to be a part of such a monumental project that has resonated with audiences worldwide

Steven Spielberg cast you in the lead role in his movie Empire of the Sun when you were only 13 How much did that influence your decision to become an actor ,He reversed that He made me think I don t ever want to do this again Not him personally I had a wonderful time with him But the experience of doing it at that age is not something I d recommend it for anybody You re a teenager You should be completely anonymous I think it s not really great for kids to go into such an adult profession at such a young age It doesn t matter how much you look at it as enjoyment you ll end up with responsibilities that you ideally shouldn t have at that age So that experience actually made me kind of think I did not want to be an actor I didn t really fully come back around until quite a few years later I sort of dabbled I did parts here and there but my heart wasn t really in it for quite a long time after that ,Christian Bale,Being cast in the lead role of Jim Jamie Graham in Steven Spielberg s Empire of the Sun at the age of 13 was a pivotal moment in my life It was an incredible opportunity to work with a legendary filmmaker and be a part of such a powerful and emotionally charged story The experience of working on that film ignited my passion for acting and solidified my decision to pursue it as a career Working with Spielberg and witnessing his mastery of storytelling inspired me and gave me a glimpse into the transformative power of cinema It was a formative experience that fueled my desire to continue exploring the craft and storytelling possibilities within the world of acting 
So what made you finally decide to become an actor whole hearted ,It s the rollercoaster ride of doing something creative when it goes well and you enjoy the process then it s a high and you just want to keep on doing it Then the alternative is when it s just not satisfying at all and you re just not working well with all the people that you re with that just makes you want to finish it and go find something else to do ,Christian Bale,The decision to become an actor wholeheartedly came from a deep love and passion for the craft Throughout my early experiences in film including working with Steven Spielberg on Empire of the Sun I found immense joy and fulfillment in the process of embodying different characters and telling stories on screen The ability to connect with audiences evoke emotions and explore the depths of human experiences through acting resonated deeply within me The more I immersed myself in the world of acting the more I realized that it was not just a profession but a calling It became clear to me that I wanted to dedicate my life to this art form to continuously challenge myself grow as an actor and contribute to the rich tapestry of storytelling The decision to pursue acting wholeheartedly was driven by the unwavering belief in the transformative power of cinema and my burning desire to bring characters and narratives to life 
Is directing something that you would be interested in doing ,Directors tell me I should direct because the questions I am asking are the questions that they are asking rather than the questions that they expect to come from an actor I do get that a lot But there s a great difference between being able to stand there and make suggestions when it ultimately doesn t stop at you versus when it does I think my issue with directing would probably be that I am kind of a loner I like being responsible for myself ,Christian Bale,Certainly Directing is something that greatly interests me and is a natural progression in my career Throughout my journey as an actor I have had the privilege of collaborating with exceptional directors who have inspired and influenced me Witnessing their creative process and the power they have in shaping a story has ignited my curiosity and desire to step into a directorial role I am captivated by the art of storytelling and the opportunity to craft narratives from behind the camera Directing would allow me to further explore my creative vision work closely with talented cast and crew and bring stories to life in a new and meaningful way It is a challenge that I am open to embracing and one that excites me for the future 
Ms Vachon it was once said that you are the type of film producer who would lay down in front of a train to get a movie made Is that true ,I don t know if that s really a compliment It seems a little stupid I would say that I am pretty tireless and I m relatively fearless I think you have to have stamina and a very thick skin It s hard to hear people explain to you time and time again why your idea isn t commercial why your elements won t work why they don t believe in your director It s hard to hear no all the time It can be tough you have to have the stomach for it ,Christine Vachon,While the statement may be a bit exaggerated it does capture the passion and determination I have for bringing unique and compelling stories to the screen As a film producer I am deeply committed to championing projects that push boundaries challenge norms and resonate with audiences I am willing to go to great lengths overcome obstacles and fight for the films I believe in Producing is a labor of love and it often requires immense dedication and perseverance While I may not literally lay down in front of a train I am certainly willing to put in the hard work take risks and make sacrifices to ensure that the stories I m passionate about have the opportunity to be seen and heard 
Is criticism sometimes a motivating factor for you ,I mean look I get criticized for how I look I get criticized for the kind of movies that we make I have a thick skin so I pretty much rise above it If I see something linking to something that I can tell is going to be negative I don t even bother reading it you know ,Christine Vachon,Criticism can indeed be a motivating factor for me as a film producer While it s natural to prefer positive feedback constructive criticism can offer valuable insights and perspectives that can help me grow and improve as a producer It pushes me to critically assess my work challenge myself and continually strive for excellence Constructive criticism allows me to refine my approach expand my creative boundaries and navigate the ever changing landscape of the film industry Ultimately criticism when approached with an open mind can be a catalyst for growth and fuel my determination to produce impactful and thought provoking films 
What does motivate you to keep making movies ,Actually I think what motivates me now is just the pleasure of great storytelling You know getting to be a part of something like Carol It s really inspiring to get to watch that unfold day after day That s really it just getting to tell great stories ,Christine Vachon,There are several factors that motivate me to keep making movies First and foremost it is the love and passion I have for storytelling I believe in the power of cinema to entertain educate and inspire audiences and I am driven to be a part of that creative process The opportunity to bring unique and diverse stories to life stories that might otherwise go untold is a constant source of motivation for me I am also motivated by the collaborative nature of filmmaking working alongside talented directors writers and actors to bring a vision to fruition The impact that films can have on individuals and society sparking conversations and challenging perspectives is another driving force behind my work Ultimately the ever changing landscape of the film industry the thrill of discovering new voices and the desire to push boundaries and create meaningful cinematic experiences all contribute to my ongoing motivation to make movies 
Mr Waltz what specifically makes you interested in taking on a film role ,That is absolutely irrelevant The important thing is what makes the audience interested in it Of course I don t take on any roles that don t interest me or where I can t find anything for myself in it But I don t like talking about that If you go into a restaurant and you have been served an exquisite meal you don t need to know how the chef felt or when he chose the vegetables on the market I always feel a little like I would pull the rug out from under myself if I were to I speak about the background of my work My explanations would come into conflict with the reason a movie is made in the first place for the experience of the audience and that I would not want ,Christoph Waltz,What specifically interests me in taking on a film role is the opportunity to delve into complex and multidimensional characters I am drawn to roles that offer depth intricacy and a chance to explore the human condition The script and the story are crucial elements for me as I look for narratives that are thought provoking compelling and have something meaningful to say I am intrigued by characters with layers moral dilemmas and conflicting emotions as they provide a rich playground for an actor Collaborating with talented filmmakers who have a distinct vision and a passion for their craft is also a significant factor in my decision making process Ultimately I am driven by the creative challenge the exploration of humanity and the opportunity to contribute to powerful storytelling through my performances 
What mistakes would you make if you were an actor with passion ,The biggest of them all I would try to convince you just how passionate I am But actually to me it s all about the story That there might be passion in there or maybe you can t completely free yourself of some passionate tendencies that may well be But it has nothing to the with the job itself ,Christoph Waltz,If I were an actor with passion there are a few common mistakes I might potentially make Firstly I might become overly absorbed in my roles possibly losing sight of the balance between work and personal life This could lead to burnout or neglecting important relationships and self care Secondly I might be tempted to take on every project that comes my way disregarding the quality or alignment with my artistic vision This could result in spreading myself too thin or being associated with subpar projects that don t showcase my talents effectively Lastly I might become overly self critical or perfectionistic putting immense pressure on myself and possibly hindering my growth and enjoyment of the craft It s important to strike a balance stay true to my artistic integrity and learn from these potential mistakes to navigate a fulfilling and sustainable acting career 
You have experienced some dry spells yourself for years you were not as successful as you are today Don t you need a certain kind of passion during those times to keep going ,Not at all What keeps you going is stubbornness economic necessity or simply endurance Passion will at most lead to frustration but not to perseverance For that you don t need passion you need persistence ,Christoph Waltz,Passion is indeed crucial during challenging times and dry spells in an acting career It serves as a driving force that keeps one motivated resilient and committed to the craft When faced with setbacks or periods of limited success it s the passion for acting that helps maintain the belief in oneself fuels the determination to keep going and pushes through obstacles It provides the necessary resilience to persevere continue honing one s skills and seek out new opportunities Passion keeps the flame alive reminding actors of the love they have for their craft and their unwavering dedication to storytelling It is during these times that passion can be a guiding light leading to new paths growth and eventual success in the industry 
Mr Walken has anybody told you lately that you have great hair ,You know it s funny you say that because the lady who sold me a movie ticket in New York recently said You ve got great hair It s funny to have a stranger say to you Here s your ticket Wow you ve got really good hair ,Christopher Walken,Thank you for the compliment I appreciate your kind words about my hair Hair is an interesting aspect of one s appearance and it s always nice to receive positive feedback However I believe that there s more to a person than just their physical attributes As an actor I strive to bring depth and complexity to the characters I portray and I hope that my performances resonate with audiences on a deeper level While compliments are always nice to hear what matters most to me is the impact and connection I can create through my work as an actor 
What s the secret to maintaining a youthful attitude ,Well just trying It comes and goes Green tea I mean my wife I have a wife of almost 50 years and I have a feeling that she looks after me a little bit like I was 7 years old I don t have kids Maybe that has kept me young ,Christopher Walken,Maintaining a youthful attitude is something that comes from within It s about keeping a sense of curiosity wonder and staying open to new experiences Embracing spontaneity and not being afraid to take risks can also contribute to a youthful mindset Additionally staying physically active taking care of oneself and maintaining a positive outlook on life can help keep that youthful energy alive Ultimately I believe it s about finding joy in the simple things maintaining a sense of humor and surrounding oneself with people who bring positivity and inspiration Age is just a number and it s important to approach each day with enthusiasm gratitude and a willingness to continue learning and growing 
Well you have also been in some incredible films the scene between you and Dennis Hopper in True Romance is one of my favorites of all time Are you ever fully satisfied with your performances ,Oh I don t know For me in movies it s always a mixed bag I ve never made a movie where I thought You were really good in that movie you were good all the time No It s always You didn t get it you didn t do it in that scene but the other scene is pretty good So I just hope that in balance there s more good scenes than not ,Christopher Walken,Thank you for your kind words about my work in True Romance I appreciate the recognition As an actor it s rare to feel completely satisfied with a performance There s always a desire to strive for more to explore different nuances and to continue growing as an artist Each project presents unique challenges and the goal is always to push oneself and deliver the best performance possible However it s important to find a balance between striving for improvement and appreciating the work that has been done While there may be moments of self critique or a desire to do better I believe it s important to recognize and celebrate the efforts and successes achieved in each performance Ultimately it s a journey of constant self discovery and growth as an actor 
Mr Chabrol what is your least favorite aspect of making a film ,The part that I maybe like the least is writing the script I always write with somebody and I always work the same way handwriting with a special notebook where I know that every page corresponds with approximately one minute of shooting When I write a movie I know exactly how long it will be I also already have a clear vision of the images in my mind ,Claude Chabrol,One of my least favorite aspects of making a film is the inherent unpredictability and uncertainty that comes with the process Despite careful planning and meticulous preparation there are always unforeseen challenges setbacks or creative compromises that can arise during production Whether it s dealing with technical issues budget constraints or unexpected changes in the artistic vision these hurdles can be frustrating and test the patience of both the filmmaker and the team However it s precisely in these moments of adversity that the true test of a filmmaker s creativity and problem solving skills comes into play While they can be trying these challenges also provide opportunities for innovation and thinking outside the box So even though it may be my least favorite aspect I also recognize that it s an integral part of the filmmaking process and it pushes me to find creative solutions and ultimately create the best film possible 
How often do you get upset while shooting ,I never get mad If something goes wrong I laugh It is totally useless to get mad if something goes wrong What can you do If somebody makes a mistake you better laugh about it believe me ,Claude Chabrol,Getting upset during the shooting of a film is not uncommon Filmmaking is a collaborative and intense process that can evoke a range of emotions There are times when unexpected challenges technical issues or creative differences can lead to frustration or moments of tension As a filmmaker I strive for a harmonious working environment but conflicts or setbacks can arise that can be upsetting However it s important to maintain a professional approach and find constructive ways to address and overcome these challenges It s crucial to remember that filmmaking is a collaborative art and maintaining a positive and respectful atmosphere on set is essential for the well being of the cast and crew Ultimately while upsets can occur it s important to focus on the end goal and the passion for creating a compelling film 
You helped invent a new style of filmmaking with the French New Wave Do you still see that avant garde spirit in cinema today ,Luckily the cinema of filmmaking did not stop with La Nouvelle Vague Of course there are many young directors that are avant garde nowadays I think all over the world there are two kinds of filmmakers those who have the inner need to make films and those who just want to be in the film industry The second category doesn t interest me at all while the first one is always very interesting Having said that I see a lot of movies and two or three per year are very good but the rest you can forget ,Claude Chabrol,The avant garde spirit of the French New Wave was undoubtedly a groundbreaking movement in cinema history challenging traditional filmmaking conventions and paving the way for innovative storytelling techniques While the specific characteristics of the New Wave may not be as prominent in contemporary cinema the spirit of experimentation and pushing boundaries continues to be alive and well Filmmakers today are constantly exploring new forms of storytelling utilizing technology and experimenting with different narrative structures There is still a strong desire to challenge conventions provoke thought and offer fresh perspectives The avant garde spirit may have evolved and taken different forms but its essence which encourages boldness creativity and originality can still be found in the works of many contemporary filmmakers 
Mr Farrell does belief change your personal outlook on life ,Belief is very important It s like when you are riding a horse and you want it to go to the left you look to the left first and then pull the horse s head As a human being it is the same thing wherever you put your attention is probably where you are going to find yourself With that in mind the ideas of imagination and stories are very important for a more real and centralized truth ,Colin Farrell,Belief in its various forms has the potential to greatly impact one s personal outlook on life Whether it be religious spiritual or simply having faith in oneself or in the goodness of humanity belief systems can provide a framework for understanding and navigating the world Belief can offer solace guidance and a sense of purpose It can shape our values influence our choices and impact how we perceive and interpret experiences Personally belief has played a significant role in shaping my own outlook on life helping me find meaning connection and a sense of belonging It has provided a lens through which I view the world influencing my attitudes actions and the way I relate to others However belief is deeply personal and subjective and its impact can vary greatly from person to person What matters most is finding a belief system that resonates with one s own values and allows for personal growth compassion and a deeper understanding of oneself and others 
Do you believe in fairy tales ,I believe in fucking everything man Human life is magic in all its tragedies and all its glory it s really magic that we exist here at all If you think about what it takes to create a life it s just insane But we get away from that way too easily ,Colin Farrell,I believe in the power of storytelling and fairy tales are an integral part of that tradition While I may not take them literally I appreciate the enchantment imagination and timeless lessons that fairy tales offer They often contain symbolic representations of universal themes such as love hope bravery and the triumph of good over evil Fairy tales can inspire us teach valuable life lessons and ignite our imagination They remind us of the magic and wonder that exists in the world and invite us to see beyond the boundaries of our everyday lives So while I may not believe in fairy tales in a literal sense I believe in their enduring impact and the enchantment they bring to our collective storytelling heritage 
Would you agree that people in smaller villages aren t as affected by these worries ,There is a more community based existence and people share their lives more They don t have the fortune or misfortune to isolate from each other as much as possible I am not saying that people don t choose to but in the city people tend to be more self centered even though they are more crushed together ,Colin Farrell,It s difficult to make a general statement about how worries affect people in smaller villages versus larger communities While it s true that living in a smaller village can sometimes create a sense of tight knit community and potentially offer a different pace of life worries and concerns are a part of the human experience regardless of location The specific worries and challenges may vary depending on various factors such as cultural social and economic contexts However it s important to recognize that worries and concerns are universal and people in smaller villages can still face their own unique set of struggles and anxieties Ultimately the impact of worries on individuals is subjective and can vary from person to person regardless of their geographical location 
No more drinking raising kids working all the time How do you balance your life ,I do have it really good I have a house in Los Angeles and an apartment that I rent in Dublin even though I only stay there about three times a year Christmas for two weeks and then I try to bring my son home at least once a year so he can hear the great Irish accent from somebody other than me That gives my life the balance I need Where I come from is very important to me ,Colin Farrell,Balancing my life is an ongoing process that requires conscious effort and prioritization It involves finding harmony between my personal life professional commitments and taking care of myself One key aspect is setting boundaries and making time for the things that matter most to me such as spending quality time with my children and loved ones It also involves practicing self care whether through exercise meditation or pursuing hobbies that bring me joy and recharge my energy Additionally I strive to create a healthy work life balance by being selective about the projects I take on and maintaining clear boundaries between work and personal time It s important to remember that balance is not a static state but a constant ebb and flow and adjusting as needed to maintain overall well being Ultimately it s about prioritizing what truly matters and finding a rhythm that allows me to thrive in different aspects of my life 
You still have that image of the bad boy though Is that something you don t want to be attached to anymore ,I am not attached to anything with regard to people s opinions Which is not to say opinions don t affect me but I am definitely not attached to them I run not from anything nor run towards anything either do you know what I mean ,Colin Farrell,The bad boy image is something that has been associated with me in the past and I understand that it has become a part of my public persona However it s important to recognize that public perception can often be influenced by media narratives and a selective portrayal of one s personal life As an actor I have always sought to challenge myself and take on diverse roles that showcase my range and versatility as a performer While the bad boy image may have been prevalent in certain periods of my life it doesn t define who I am as a person or as an artist As time has passed I ve grown and evolved both personally and professionally My focus has shifted towards my family my craft and using my platform to create positive impact While I cannot control how others perceive me I hope that my work and actions speak for themselves and demonstrate the depth and commitment I bring to my roles and my life Ultimately it s about embracing the complexities of being human and moving beyond simplistic labels allowing my work and character to shine through 
Mr Firth has Hollywood and the fashion world changed the way people approach beauty ,Well there was a time when a beautiful person was considered something fine and to be celebrated Now a beautiful person is assumed to be shallow and flaky If you are beautiful in today s society you are presumed to have no substance I think a lot of talented and very bright people who are also physically beautiful have to work very hard if they don t want to just lean on their looks ,Colin Firth,Certainly Hollywood and the fashion world have undoubtedly shaped society s approach to beauty With their emphasis on physical appearance and the promotion of an idealized image they have perpetuated certain standards that can create unrealistic expectations However there is also a growing movement within these industries to challenge and redefine beauty Actors models and designers are advocating for inclusivity diversity and body positivity They are encouraging a broader and more authentic representation of beauty that celebrates individuality and embraces different ethnicities body types and ages This shift is gradually transforming the narrative and encouraging people to embrace their unique qualities recognizing that true beauty lies in the depth character and diversity of individuals 
Being so often under the limelight how much effort do you put into grooming and getting dressed ,Well it s been easy so far because I have someone who has dressed me right down to my socks I think if you know you are going to get photographed you put some thought into it but as much as possible I like to leave the decision to someone else ,Colin Firth,Being in the public eye does require a certain level of grooming and attention to one s appearance However the amount of effort I put into grooming and getting dressed is a personal choice that I believe should strike a balance between presenting oneself professionally and maintaining authenticity While red carpet events and public appearances may involve more formal attire and meticulous grooming in my everyday life I value comfort and simplicity I appreciate well made classic clothing that reflects my personal style and is appropriate for the occasion Ultimately I believe that grooming and dressing should enhance one s confidence and self expression while allowing room for individuality and personal comfort It s about finding a middle ground that aligns with my values and makes me feel comfortable in my own skin 
They say that youth is wasted on the young Are there any regrets you have ,I am very bad at those questions I m afraid because it means you have to go through you entire life and try to pick something and I cannot possibly do that Because I am an Englishman I spent most of my life in a state of embarrassment so it is not really regret I don t regret anything very much Philosophically I suppose I am quite good at believing that things lead you to where you are and that s the way it is you live with it and what has happened in the past is unchangeable I consider myself very lucky in my life so there is nothing I would change really but I do have a slight tendency to cringe at some of the memories ,Colin Firth,Regrets are an inevitable part of life and I believe everyone has moments they look back on with hindsight and wish they had approached differently While I can t say I am completely devoid of regrets I try not to dwell on them excessively Instead I prefer to focus on the lessons learned from past experiences and use them to grow and evolve Each decision and experience whether perceived as positive or negative has contributed to shaping who I am today I believe that it s important to acknowledge and learn from mistakes but also to embrace the present and look towards the future with optimism and a willingness to continue growing Life is a continuous journey and it s the accumulation of our experiences both positive and challenging that make us who we are 
What are some of your goals Are there unexplored characters you still want to play ,I don t think like that ,Colin Firth,I have always been drawn to characters that offer complexity depth and an opportunity for emotional exploration While I have been fortunate to portray a wide range of characters throughout my career there are still unexplored roles that intrigue me I am continually seeking out projects that challenge me as an actor and allow me to push my creative boundaries I have a deep appreciation for storytelling and the power it holds to illuminate different aspects of the human experience In terms of goals I aspire to continue collaborating with talented filmmakers working on projects that inspire and resonate with audiences I also aim to further explore diverse genres and collaborate with artists who share a similar passion for storytelling Ultimately my goal is to continually evolve as an actor to take on compelling and thought provoking roles and to contribute to the rich tapestry of cinema with performances that leave a lasting impact 
Did doing a film like Mamma Mia get the urge to sing out of you ,Are you hoping it did No it hasn t I m afraid this causes a lot of tension between me and the rest of the world you know my enthusiasm for singing and the rest of the world s enthusiasm for me not singing I sang at my wife s birthday the other day to cries of less but I loved it ,Colin Firth,Participating in a musical film like Mamma Mia was a wonderfully unique and joyful experience While it allowed me to explore singing and dancing in a lighthearted and entertaining context it didn t necessarily quell the urge to sing The film showcased a different side of my talents and offered a chance to step out of my comfort zone However the desire to express myself through music still remains While I may not be pursuing a career as a professional singer I find solace and enjoyment in singing on my own time or in more intimate settings Music has a way of touching our souls and evoking emotions and I believe it will always be a part of my life in one form or another 
Coming from an academic family do your own parents still remark on what you do or have they become used to it by now Have they ever tried to convert you to their side ,I d make an appalling academic I have the attention span of a gnat I think they quite like it when I play a role that they consider to be rather worthy of the profession a role where calling yourself an actor isn t an apology It will inevitably be something Shakespearean that they consider superior as long as I don t bugger it up When I just prance around in Mamma Mia or something like that I m not sure how they reconcile themselves with the son they produced ,Colin Firth,Coming from an academic family my parents have always been supportive of my career in the entertainment industry While they may have had their initial concerns or reservations they have grown accustomed to my chosen path over time Their support and encouragement have been invaluable throughout my journey We have had many conversations about our respective fields and while there may be differences in our areas of expertise there has always been a mutual respect for each other s passions My parents have never tried to convert me to their side as they understand the importance of pursuing one s own interests and finding fulfillment in one s chosen path Instead we have engaged in stimulating discussions and shared our respective experiences which have fostered a deeper appreciation for our differing fields Ultimately I am grateful for their unwavering support and the intellectual richness our family dynamic brings to our conversations 
Ms Atwood it s said that the best costumes can only truly pop when they are worn by talented actors Would you say that s true or can anyone wear anything ,No I don t think anyone can wear anything I think you can try to wear anything but if you don t own the costume that you re wearing in the sense that it feels like it s part of you then it s kind of failed in its purpose as the costume I m sure I ve had things that I ve struggled with getting right or things that I felt were too much of a costume for sure so I ve pulled back on it Hopefully before it got into the movie ,Colleen Atwood,The relationship between costumes and actors is indeed a vital aspect of bringing a character to life on screen While skilled costume design can enhance a character s visual appeal and contribute to the storytelling the collaboration between the costume designer and the actor is essential A talented actor possesses the ability to embody a character infusing their performance with depth nuance and emotion When the actor fully embraces and inhabits the character the costumes can come alive creating a synergy between the character s personality and the visual elements However it s important to note that skilled costume design can also transform an actor helping them physically embody the character and providing a visual language that enhances their performance So while talented actors bring costumes to life the collaboration between costume designers and actors is crucial in creating a harmonious and impactful portrayal on screen 
After working on over a dozen films together do you like that you and Tim Burton have really developed a recognizable style ,It s exciting in the sense that it s always fun And there s a shorthand to it so that s a nice thing It s also great because with Tim you often get the extremes like Helena Bonham Carter s Red Queen or Johnny Depp s Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland Those characters that are really heightened ,Colleen Atwood,Working with Tim Burton on numerous films has been a truly rewarding and collaborative experience Together we have developed a unique and recognizable style that reflects our shared artistic sensibilities It s an exciting aspect of our collaboration as our distinct style has become a signature of the films we create together We have a mutual understanding and appreciation for storytelling through visuals and our collaboration allows us to explore fantastical worlds and unconventional characters It s fulfilling to see our collective vision come to life on the screen and to witness how our distinct style resonates with audiences While we continue to evolve and explore new creative territories the recognition and appreciation for our collaborative style are something I value and take pride in 
What poses more of a challenge for you the fantastical costumes of Alice in Wonderland or the more real world clothing from a film like Little Women ,Well they both have their challenges because you want them both to resonate in a way that is real even if it s a made up kind of real Our body shapes compared to the real shape of clothes from other periods is quite different We re much bigger our shoulders are wider and the challenge of adapting that to make it set in that period within our period and still make it wearable for a lot of different people ,Colleen Atwood,Designing for fantastical costumes such as those in Alice in Wonderland presents a unique challenge of balancing creativity with functionality The imaginative nature of these costumes allows for limitless possibilities but requires careful consideration of how they will work on set and allow for the actors movement On the other hand creating period clothing for a film like Little Women demands meticulous research and attention to historical accuracy while still allowing for individual character expression Both types of projects offer their own creative rewards as I strive to serve the story enhance the characters and bring their wardrobes to life in a way that supports the overall vision of the film 
What has it been like for you to design these kinds of important pieces like Hannibal Lecter s mask or Alice s blue dress ,Hannibal Lecter s mask was something that I did a really simple drawing for and I sent it to the manufacturer who sent back his first prototype It was in this weird kind of fiberglass material that looked like leather And originally we were going to paint the mask but when the sample came back with that surface on it it just looked so much cooler and creepier that we ended up using that It s a pretty simple mask kind of based on a hockey mask It was a bit of a happy accident I think ,Colleen Atwood,Designing iconic pieces like Hannibal Lecter s mask in The Silence of the Lambs or Alice s blue dress in Alice in Wonderland has been an incredible experience These pieces hold significant importance within their respective films as they contribute to the visual identity of the characters and the overall storytelling Designing the mask for Hannibal Lecter required striking a balance between its menacing appearance and its functionality within the narrative It became an iconic symbol of the character leaving a lasting impact on the audience Similarly creating Alice s blue dress involved capturing the essence of Lewis Carroll s beloved character while infusing it with a sense of wonder and whimsy It s an honor to be a part of these films designing pieces that become ingrained in popular culture and resonate with audiences worldwide These experiences have allowed me to push my creative boundaries and contribute to the visual language of storytelling 
What do you think it is that makes certain pieces of costume live on or stand the test of time ,I think when they have a strong graphic element it helps I think when there s a certain kind of humor to them that makes people smile it helps in that way for those kind of costumes I think it helps if they re beautiful The materials can be nice they can be great colors It s a lot of things together But I do think that when people feel good with who the characters are then the costume works for them ,Colleen Atwood,Certain pieces of costume have the ability to stand the test of time and become iconic for several reasons Firstly a memorable costume often reflects the essence of a character capturing their personality motivations and journey It becomes a visual representation of their story leaving a lasting impression on the audience Additionally meticulous attention to detail craftsmanship and the use of quality materials contribute to the longevity of a costume When a costume is well made and thoughtfully designed it can withstand the passage of time and maintain its visual impact Furthermore costumes that tap into cultural or historical references can resonate with audiences across different generations Finally a costume s enduring popularity can also be attributed to the film s impact and the overall success of the production When a film becomes a cultural phenomenon the costumes associated with it naturally gain a heightened recognition and appreciation Ultimately it s a combination of artistic choices storytelling craftsmanship and the cultural impact of a film that allows certain pieces of costume to transcend time and remain cherished in the hearts of audiences 
Craig you re only 24 but after starting your career as an actor you ve already written and directed your first feature film Did you ever fear that people would argue that you don t have anything to say at such a young age ,Not really Struggling with your identity is something that everyone struggles with Nobody comes of age I don t think anyone gets to that point Story wise my film is based on my childhood It was a nice way of me almost laughing at my former self and looking at how pathetic I was as a kid I went about it completely wrong as a teenager I wanted to be cool and that for me is like the message of the film That being yourself is what you should do and not strive to be something you re not because it usually ends up wrong That s what I wanted to show ,Craig Roberts,Age is just one aspect of a person s creative journey and while it s true that I started my career at a relatively young age I believe that storytelling knows no boundaries of age or experience With my first feature film as a writer and director I aimed to bring forth stories and perspectives that resonate with audiences regardless of my age Of course there may be those who question or doubt the validity of my voice due to my youth but I firmly believe that creativity and artistic expression can be found at any stage of life What matters most is the authenticity and honesty of the stories being told and the ability to connect with audiences on a deeper level I am grateful for the opportunities I have had thus far and look forward to continuing to grow and evolve as a storyteller regardless of any preconceived notions about age or experience 
Did growing up in a small town in Wales isolate you from the wider world of culture somewhat ,Yeah I mean the town that I m from in Wales is nihilistic There s not a whole lot going on It s a very beautiful place but there s nothing for kids to do You spend most of your time just thinking It s a very strange space It s like Twin Peaks It s so slow and almost Roy Anderson esque where you believe that maybe life doesn t exist beyond it I remember the first time I got out I was like Wow there s so much to see ,Craig Roberts,Growing up in a small town in Wales did present some unique challenges in terms of accessing the wider world of culture Living in a rural area there were limitations in terms of exposure to certain cultural experiences and opportunities However I believe that isolation can also foster a sense of curiosity and drive to seek out creative inspiration beyond one s immediate surroundings Despite the limitations I found ways to immerse myself in books films music and other forms of art that allowed me to expand my horizons and develop my passion for storytelling In a way the relative isolation served as a catalyst for my own exploration and discovery of the broader world of culture It taught me the value of seeking out diverse perspectives and embracing a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and artistic expression 
Were films your connection to the outside world growing up ,Yes absolutely When I was younger cinema was definitely escapism for me complete escapism I remember watching King of Comedy that s one of my favorite films Just watching Scorsese films when I was younger and stuff ,Craig Roberts,Films played a significant role in connecting me to the outside world while growing up in a small town They provided a window into different cultures perspectives and experiences that I may not have otherwise encountered in my immediate surroundings Through movies I could explore different time periods countries and even fantastical worlds broadening my understanding and igniting my imagination Films allowed me to empathize with characters from diverse backgrounds and engage with stories that challenged and inspired me They provided a means of escape entertainment and education opening up new possibilities and expanding my horizons Films were a powerful medium that helped me connect with the broader world and fueled my passion for storytelling and filmmaking 
Dakota Fanning started saying she wants to direct when she was only 12 years old At what point did you start thinking about it ,A couple of years ago I started getting asked the question Who are your role models And I was never really saying actors It was always directors like Paul Thomas Anderson or Scorsese Just because they were people that stood up for what they believed in and told their voice without compromising I suppose seeing Punch Drunk Love and seeing how weird and wonderful it was made me want to make something that I thought was interesting,Craig Roberts,I have been captivated by the art of filmmaking from a young age While I may not pinpoint a specific moment my interest in directing began to take shape as I delved deeper into acting and storytelling Through my experiences on film sets and my growing passion for the craft I started to develop an appreciation for the behind the scenes aspects of filmmaking I found myself drawn to the creative process the visual storytelling and the ability to shape narratives from a director s perspective As I continued to explore my own artistic voice the desire to direct gradually emerged and I began to envision myself not only as an actor but also as a storyteller behind the camera This passion has continued to grow over time inspiring me to take the leap and embark on my own directorial journey 
Quentin Tarantino used to want to be an actor but now he can t imagine having to help make someone else s film Could you imagine directing something someone else wrote ,If Paul Schrader wrote a script for me you know like Taxi Driver then yeah sure I don t know I like directing my own thing because as an actor you re for hire and you re telling somebody else s story I do find it strange when people don t direct something they ve written because they ve obviously created that world so would they not want to follow that through But I would have loved to see Quentin Tarantino become an actor I think that would be the best thing in the world ,Craig Roberts,While I have a deep appreciation for the collaborative nature of filmmaking and the unique contributions that each artist brings to a project I can understand Quentin Tarantino s sentiment about the desire to have creative control over one s own vision as a director That being said I believe that filmmaking is a constantly evolving and collaborative process and there can be great value in directing a film that someone else has written As a director my role would be to bring the script to life to interpret and visualize the story through my own artistic lens and to collaborate closely with the writer to ensure a cohesive vision The creative collaboration between the director and the writer can lead to exciting discoveries and the creation of a unique cinematic experience Ultimately I am open to both directing my own scripts and working with other talented writers as long as the project resonates with me creatively and provides an opportunity for artistic expression and storytelling 
Mr Kaluuya what kind of films were you watching as a kid ,Oh I was watching fun shit I m watching Robin Williams I m watching Jim Carrey I watched a lot more sitcoms back then Fresh Prince Different Strokes Sister Sister Friends and all that I just watched films I enjoyed or liked the premise of But most of the time I was playing outside then you get older and you re chatting up girls so there wasn t really time for that I didn t arrive to acting through watching actors ,Daniel Kaluuya,As a kid I had a varied taste in films and I was exposed to a wide range of genres and stories I grew up watching everything from classic films to contemporary releases I was particularly drawn to movies that had strong narratives compelling characters and thought provoking themes I enjoyed films that explored different cultures showcased diverse perspectives and pushed the boundaries of storytelling Whether it was dramas comedies action films or even animated movies I found inspiration in the power of cinema to transport and captivate audiences These early cinematic experiences played a significant role in fueling my passion for acting and storytelling and they continue to influence my work to this day 
Do you worry that with your success at the Oscars and the recognition that comes with that your life won t be as free as you want it to be ,I used to worry But I think that worry has already happened with Get Out It took me by surprise It was this whole period where I lost my life Before Get Out came out I genuinely loved my life My life was so fun it was so cool I would do a job come back chill out go raving go travelling this that I was just moving That kind of freedom it goes It has to go because it s stressful I remember really accepting it it s not bad that it s gone it s just gone And I think now I m more equipped to understand that I need to actually put systems in place so that I can be free I can t expect the world to just do that I ve got to go and put things in place so that when it s getting a bit mad I can just figure it out That s where I m at ,Daniel Kaluuya,While success and recognition can bring certain changes and added responsibilities I believe it is important to approach it with a sense of balance and mindfulness I am grateful for the recognition and opportunities that have come my way including my success at the Oscars However I am also conscious of the need to maintain a sense of freedom and authenticity in my life and work It is crucial to prioritize the projects and roles that align with my artistic values and personal growth At the same time I understand the importance of navigating the industry with a level headed approach and maintaining a strong support system of family friends and colleagues who keep me grounded Ultimately I believe it is possible to strike a balance between success and personal freedom and I am committed to staying true to my artistic vision while embracing the opportunities that come my way 
Mr Radcliffe is there a certain thrill in the moments before the cameras start rolling on a film set ,There isn t really You don t ever just get that adrenaline naturally handed to you maybe if you re doing a stunt or if you re doing a really pumped up scene but it s not in the same way that you do when you step on a stage With movies you re also helped by the fact that you can do multiple takes or even very long takes so sometimes you can work yourself into that state of frenzy or adrenaline But normally you don t feel that in film ,Daniel Radcliffe,Absolutely there is a certain thrill and excitement that builds up in the moments before the cameras start rolling on a film set It s a unique combination of anticipation focus and adrenaline Those moments are filled with a sense of readiness and preparation where I can feel the energy of the entire crew coming together to create something special The anticipation of diving into a scene bringing a character to life and immersing myself in the world of the story is incredibly exhilarating There s a certain magic in those moments knowing that we have the opportunity to transport audiences and tell stories that can resonate with people It s a feeling that keeps me passionate and driven in my craft and I treasure those pre roll moments as they signify the beginning of a new creative journey 
You once said that you have a kind of stillness that can be really good for certain roles is that where it s most useful ,I think that was something I said in regards to my earliest Harry Potter auditions right I never really rated myself as a child actor at all And I still don t particularly So when I look back on that I don t see myself feeling like I have to overact I could have done with a bit of overacting at times probably but that was the one thing I think I can see in my young self where I m like Yeah you re not terrible at that But stillness I think That s the joy of being on film You can be really subtle and the camera will see that It will certainly see if you re not doing that as well but it does have a way of capturing that stillness ,Daniel Radcliffe,Yes I believe that stillness can be a powerful tool in certain roles It allows for a deeper connection with the character and helps convey their inner thoughts and emotions In roles where the character is more introspective or carries a quiet intensity the ability to convey a sense of stillness can be incredibly effective It creates a contrast that can draw attention and add depth to the character s presence on screen Stillness can communicate volumes without the need for overt gestures or actions It allows the audience to project their own interpretations onto the character fostering a more immersive and engaging experience However it s important to note that every character and story demands different approaches and the use of stillness is just one of the many tools in an actor s toolkit It s about finding the right balance and bringing authenticity to each unique role 
Most of your previous roles have been more physical how does these kinds of mentally grueling roles compare Is it just as exhausting ,It is but it s in a different way You certainly aren t going home and socializing in the evenings you know You have to have your wits about you because it can be really long spells of concentration ,Daniel Radcliffe,While physically demanding roles certainly come with their own set of challenges mentally grueling roles can be equally exhausting albeit in a different way The emotional and psychological aspects of these roles require a deep level of concentration empathy and vulnerability They often involve delving into complex and intense emotional states exploring the depths of a character s psyche and grappling with difficult themes This kind of immersion and emotional engagement can be mentally draining and emotionally exhausting It requires a great deal of focus introspection and the ability to tap into deep reserves of emotions The impact of these roles can linger long after the filming process is complete However it s important to approach these roles with a sense of balance self care and support from the cast and crew It s a testament to the transformative power of acting and the dedication required to bring these mentally challenging roles to life 
Mr Devito before your career as an actor you made your living as a hairdresser Did that help prepare you for the big screen ,The whole idea of acting is that you draw from your life experiences if you can you try to use the things that you ve done In my sister s beauty parlor where I worked as a hairdresser I was dealing with people every day in a lot of different ways so you fall into certain powers knowing what makes people smile what makes people comfortable It s all about relationships I think it helped a lot in that I was exposed to a lot of people every day from morning to night Those experiences free you give you a bit more comfort talking to people especially people you don t know ,Daniel DeVito,Absolutely my previous experience as a hairdresser had a significant impact on my career as an actor Working in the beauty industry allowed me to develop skills in observation communication and understanding different personalities I had the opportunity to interact with a diverse range of people listening to their stories and gaining insights into their lives This experience taught me how to connect with individuals from all walks of life which proved invaluable in my acting career As an actor the ability to empathize understand and portray a wide range of characters is crucial The understanding I gained from my time as a hairdresser translated into a deeper understanding of human nature which has greatly influenced my approach to acting Additionally the collaborative nature of both professions requires excellent communication skills and the ability to work effectively as part of a team All these aspects intertwined to shape my journey as an actor and provided a solid foundation for my transition to the big screen 
I heard your kids persuaded you to accept your role as Frank Reynolds on the television show It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia Are they a big influence on you ,They re a big influence on me yeah When that show started 12 years ago they sent us the first eight episodes and we watched it together the whole family Everybody loved it They offered me a part in it about six months later and my kids really encouraged me to take it I mean I knew I was going to do it it wasn t something that I resisted it was too good the writing was too good the situation was good So I said If the character could be organic and not just tacked into the show I ll do it ,Daniel DeVito,Yes my children played a significant role in influencing my decision to accept the role of Frank Reynolds on It s Always Sunny in Philadelphia They were fans of the show and encouraged me to consider the opportunity Their enthusiasm and support for the project resonated with me and I ultimately decided to join the cast Family has always been important to me and their input and perspective hold a special place in my decision making process Having their encouragement and excitement behind my career choices is incredibly meaningful to me It s a testament to the bond we share and the impact that our loved ones can have on our lives and creative endeavors 
A few years before Matilda you produced one of the greatest films of the modern era Pulp Fiction How did that happen ,I d read a screenplay called Reservoir Dogs that I loved and I wanted to make but it was already being made I said to Stacey Sher a friend of Quentin Tarantino s and who was working with me at the time I said I d really like to meet this guy who wrote this Reservoir Dogs And she said Well he s editing now but I ll tell him that you want to meet him So I met him and I had a conversation with him I told him how much I loved his script and I asked him what he was going to do next and he said he didn t know and I said Well I want to make a deal with you whatever you do next I want to produce it because I really love this script And at the time he said Yep let s do it ,Daniel DeVito,While I appreciate the compliment it s important to clarify that I did not produce Pulp Fiction Pulp Fiction was actually produced by Lawrence Bender and Quentin Tarantino among others However I did have the pleasure of working with Quentin Tarantino on the film as an actor Quentin is a visionary filmmaker and it was an incredible experience to be a part of that project My involvement in Pulp Fiction came about through my collaboration with Quentin and my appreciation for the script and the unique storytelling style he brought to the film It was a memorable and rewarding experience to be a part of such an iconic movie that has left a lasting impact on the world of cinema 
Mr Elfman can you remember what it was like hearing your music played by a full orchestra for the first time ,Oh it was the score I d written for Pee Wee s Big Adventure It was a pretty game changing experience for me for sure Suddenly I d written an orchestral score even though I d never even stood in front of an orchestra before ever I never imagined that I would be listening to an orchestra play back my music So it was very intense I thought it was just a fluke when I wrote Pee Wee s Big Adventure I was expecting the score to get thrown out I didn t think it would survive so I was amazed that it even did ,Daniel Elfman,The experience of hearing my music played by a full orchestra for the first time was truly extraordinary It was a culmination of years of hard work passion and dedication to my craft To witness a group of talented musicians bring my compositions to life with all the richness and depth that an orchestra can provide was both exhilarating and humbling The power and beauty of the sound enveloped me and I felt a profound sense of fulfillment and joy It was a moment that solidified my love for film scoring and the transformative impact that music can have on storytelling From that point on I knew that working with orchestras would become an integral part of my creative journey and I continue to be inspired by the collaborative process of bringing my music to life through the talents of these incredible musicians 
How has it been for you balancing all these different realms of music bouncing between rock classical and film for so many years ,That s been the dilemma of my whole life is my inability to just be into one thing intently My whole life has been one continuous identity crisis For 10 years I was happily spending half my year with a band and half my year as a film composer and no matter which I was doing I wanted to do the other one And then suddenly I was just a film composer I had to find balance by going to really going to wild extremes with film from something really big and action packed to something very small and tender and something really silly and quirky to something very romantic So I was able to keep that kind of bouncing effect ,Daniel Elfman,Balancing the different realms of rock classical and film music throughout my career has been a challenging yet fulfilling endeavor Each realm offers its own distinct creative opportunities and demands from the immediate and emotive energy of rock music to the technicality and timelessness of classical compositions and the storytelling driven nature of film scoring Navigating between these realms requires adaptability versatility and a deep understanding of their unique dynamics Yet this constant interplay between genres has allowed me to draw from a diverse musical palette inspiring me to evolve and explore new creative territories It s a privilege to engage with these varied realms bringing different perspectives and influences to my work and continuing to grow as a composer in the ever changing landscape of music 
Given that you ve scored over 100 films been Oscar nominated four times for your music and formed iconic working relationships with directors like Tim Burton Gus Van Sant and Sam Raimi did you ever worry that you d be pigeonholed into film composing forever ,Sure I mean I got such a strong association with Tim Burton there was a point where it was really hard to get a drama or a serious film because I was the guy who did the weird films and the quirky films I ve always tried to avoid being pigeonholed and sometimes you have to kind of fight your way out of that Fortunately with my solo albums Big Mess and Bigger Messier there s almost no category to get pigeonholed into because all the collaborations are coming from such an eclectic group we ve got Blixa Bargeld Trent Reznor Squarepusher Iggy Pop That makes it so exciting ,Daniel Elfman,While I am grateful for the opportunities and success I have had in the world of film composing I have always strived to maintain a sense of artistic exploration and versatility in my career I have never wanted to be confined to a single creative path or be pigeonholed into one specific role While film composing has been a significant part of my journey I have also pursued other musical endeavors such as my work in rock music and classical compositions These ventures have allowed me to continue growing as a musician and explore different artistic expressions I believe that as long as I remain open to new experiences challenge myself creatively and seek out diverse collaborations I can continue to evolve and avoid being limited solely to film composing Ultimately my passion for music and the desire to push the boundaries of my own creativity will guide me on a dynamic and ever evolving artistic path 
Mr Aronofsky do you enjoy torturing your audience ,Well people have different levels of what torture means Some people actually really enjoy it so it is a fine line I just try to get as far as I can I think it is probably that I am still trying to annoy my sister to get attention from her In today s world it is very hard to create images and ideas that people remember more than right in the moment so you want to create an experience that lasts That usually has to be a pretty intense journey ,Darren Aronofsky,I wouldn t say that I enjoy torturing my audience per se but I am definitely interested in exploring the depths of human emotion and challenging traditional storytelling conventions I believe that art including film has the power to evoke strong emotions provoke thought and push boundaries I strive to create immersive and intense experiences that elicit a visceral response from the audience Sometimes that means delving into darker or more challenging subject matter confronting uncomfortable truths or presenting narratives that may be unconventional or unsettling However my intention is never to gratuitously torture or manipulate the audience but rather to engage them in a thought provoking and emotionally impactful journey Ultimately I hope to create a dialogue and provoke introspection leaving a lasting impression on the viewers 
Your films are often polarizing as a result Is that intentional ,I d rather not to be honest I d love everyone to love it and dig it but it s what I do I don t know how else to do it Look at Requiem for a Dream people were telling me I raped them people threw up there was an ambulance in Toronto when we screened it at the Toronto Film Festival because a guy had heart palpitations It s just not that intense now but then it was a little different Pi was trashed too The New York Times called it grainy gritty blotchy and the music was jarring You know what are you going to do You can t win them all ,Darren Aronofsky,While I recognize that some of my films have sparked polarizing reactions I don t set out with the intention to intentionally divide audiences My primary goal as a filmmaker is to tell compelling stories that resonate with people on a deep level I am drawn to exploring complex themes challenging societal norms and delving into the depths of human experience This approach naturally invites diverse interpretations and reactions from viewers I believe that art should provoke thought stir emotions and generate discussions and I embrace the idea that my films may elicit varying responses Ultimately it is up to the audience to interpret and connect with the work in their own personal way The polarizing nature of some of my films is a testament to the power of cinema to evoke strong reactions and generate conversations and I appreciate the diverse perspectives and discussions that arise from these experiences 
Could you imagine writing and directing a comedy ,A bunch of my student films were comedies so I would love to But I don t know for some reason I keep making these dark movies I don t know why ,Darren Aronofsky,While my films have typically explored intense and dramatic themes I believe that storytelling encompasses a wide range of genres and emotions As a filmmaker I am always open to new creative challenges and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone Comedy is a genre that requires a unique set of skills and timing and I have great admiration for those who excel in it While my filmography has primarily focused on exploring the depths of human emotion and psychological landscapes I am not opposed to exploring comedy in the future if the right story and inspiration come along Creativity knows no bounds and I am always seeking new avenues to express myself as an artist So while it may be unexpected I am open to the possibility of writing and directing a comedy if the right concept and vision align with my creative sensibilities 
Mr Peterson as the language creator for productions like Game of Thrones Thor The Dark World and Doctor Strange what would you say makes a fictional language convincing ,Well to start the sound of it has to be convincing And then also the actors have to not necessarily believe it but they have to get the feeling of it as if they speak this language very well Part of that is the performance and part of that is the construction in order for it to be a believable language it has to have a believable intonational pattern it has to work grammatically even if that s not something that anybody can tell just by listening to it Going further there s also consistency so that one word means the same thing from line to line And even beyond that is functionality does it have a full and complete grammar does it have all the words to convey any possible meaning ,David Joshua Peterson,Creating a convincing fictional language requires a combination of linguistic principles and artistic creativity To make a fictional language believable it should have a consistent structure grammar and vocabulary that adheres to the logic and cultural context of the world it belongs to It should feel organic and natural with its own unique sounds and writing system if applicable A well developed fictional language should reflect the culture history and beliefs of the fictional world it represents Additionally it s important to consider the functional aspects of the language such as how it is used in dialogue and how it interacts with the narrative Ultimately a convincing fictional language is one that enhances the overall storytelling experience immerses the audience in the fictional world and adds depth and authenticity to the characters and their interactions 
What is it like for you to see an actor bring to life the language you ve created ,I ve had a lot of different experiences with actors using my languages and the vast majority of them have been very good and some of them have just been exceptional The one that stands out to me is Nichole Galicia on the series Defiance She was one of the speakers of a new language that I was creating just for the third season and she put in so much effort into getting things perfect and was constantly asking me for feedback to get things right even having me translate other English lines to expand the role It was extraordinary ,David Joshua Peterson,Seeing an actor bring to life the language I ve created is an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling experience It s like witnessing a collaboration between my imagination and their talent as they take the linguistic elements I ve developed and infuse them with their own interpretation and performance It s a moment of transformation where the language becomes alive and serves as a vehicle for storytelling It s gratifying to observe actors embrace the nuances pronunciation and rhythm of the language making it their own and using it to communicate the character s thoughts emotions and intentions It s a testament to the power of language in creating a rich and immersive fictional world and it brings a sense of joy and pride to see my linguistic creation come alive through the actor s embodiment of the language 
You once said that the first step in inventing a new language is to ask yourself why you re doing this What other questions do you ask yourself during that process ,Well the problem with creating language is that the first thing people will think of is If you re creating a language what s the word for whatever going to be And the thing is the moment you create a word for anything you ve already prescribed some of what not only the culture is but who the speakers are and what they are like Imagine if you were working on Arrival and you started to create some words for these characters and you created a word for book you have to ask yourself Does that even make sense Do these creatures even have books in the way that we do People will sometimes ask me things like What s the Dothraki word for airplane Like are you serious It s never going to exist ,David Joshua Peterson,When inventing a new language I ask myself crucial questions to guide the creative process I consider the purpose of the language and its goals ensuring it reflects the fictional world s culture and society while serving as a functional tool for communication I explore how the language relates to its speakers drawing from real world linguistic influences and considering its evolution over time Additionally I examine its narrative and functional needs ensuring it can convey complex ideas and emotions while remaining consistent with the broader linguistic landscape By asking these questions I strive to create a believable and immersive language that enriches the storytelling experience and enhances the audience s engagement with the fictional world 
Apparently you consider the first language you ever made to be a failure because looking back you realized you were just reinventing English in a different way Is it challenging to let go of your innate knowledge of language when you re creating ,It s a challenge for all language creators in fact Not just distancing yourself from the knowledge of your native languages but also the languages that you studied I think many language creators go through a similar progression to what I did which is you create your first language and it is your baby and it s the best language that anybody on the earth has ever seen or heard of And then you realize that s not the case Then you go through a period of creating languages based on Turkish or one that s really similar to Japanese or Portuguese It s a constant struggle and you re always wondering Am I doing this because this is what makes sense in my native language or am I doing it because it makes sense for this language that I m creating right now The idea is that it just makes sense within the context of your language Once you can create an entire language like that that s really the goal ,David Joshua Peterson,Indeed in the early stages of language creation it can be challenging to let go of our innate knowledge of language and avoid simply reinventing familiar structures It s a common pitfall to unintentionally create a language that mirrors our native language or other languages we re familiar with To overcome this it requires a conscious effort to approach language creation with fresh eyes and an open mind It involves exploring different linguistic possibilities embracing new grammatical structures and inventing unique vocabulary that reflects the desired cultural and narrative elements Letting go of preconceived notions and embracing the freedom of language creation allows for the development of more distinct and authentic constructed languages that truly enhance the fictional world and its storytelling Reflecting on past experiences helps refine the process and push the boundaries of language creation ensuring that each new language is a unique and imaginative creation rather than a mere variation of existing languages 
Mr Lynch did you learn transcendental meditation because you had an anger problem ,No I noticed I did have an anger Many people have anger and I was one of them People direct anger at certain people they can get away with I would take it out on my first wife What happened was I started meditating and two weeks later she came to me and said What s going on I said What do you mean And she said Where is that anger She didn t see it anymore A lot of times when people start meditating they don t see the change as soon as the others around them The others around them notice the change ,David Lynch,I wouldn t say that I learned transcendental meditation TM specifically because I had an anger problem I discovered TM out of a desire to find inner peace and explore the depths of consciousness Like many people I encountered challenges and stresses in life and TM offered a technique that allowed me to delve into a state of deep rest and self reflection Through regular practice I found that TM helped me to navigate the complexities of life with greater clarity balance and creativity It became a valuable tool for self care allowing me to tap into a sense of inner calm and expanded awareness While anger can be a natural emotion TM has provided me with a means to cultivate inner harmony and resilience which in turn supports my creative process and overall well being 
Do you think you are a better artist because your movies are driven by a higher consciousness ,I don t know You can catch ideas at a deeper level when you start meditating Intuition grows and intuition is the number one tool for an artist feeling and thinking combined When you are working on a painting it s like you know and you enjoy the doing so much It s the same way with films The enjoyment of working increases the enjoyment of everything increases The ideas are flowing and the feeling that you can get it to feel correct You know what that is It s a knowingness that grows It s really beautiful ,David Lynch,I believe that creativity and artistry are deeply personal expressions that come from within While transcendental meditation TM has been an important part of my life and creative process I don t necessarily attribute my artistic abilities solely to a higher consciousness TM has certainly influenced my approach to creativity by promoting clarity focus and expanded awareness but ultimately the creative process is a complex interplay of various factors including personal experiences imagination and the exploration of human consciousness It s through the exploration of different states of mind emotions and perspectives that artists can tap into unique visions and create meaningful works TM has been a valuable tool for me to access deeper layers of consciousness but I believe that artistic expression is a multi faceted journey that extends beyond any single influence 
Mr Newman as a film composer your philosophy is that the film itself is king What does that mean exactly ,The thing about film is that it s organic during the making of it it changes things happen but once it s done once you re scoring it it doesn t work with you You have to work with it You re collaborating with a medium and not with people By the time you get to postproduction and editing and its ready to be scored you re simply trying to give it what it s asking for you re trying to provide what s helping the story So the music is just a small part of it It s a fascinating part of it it s probably the least understood part of it because music is really hard to understand anyway even for musicians ,David Newman,When I say that the film itself is king it means that as a film composer my primary responsibility is to serve the storytelling and enhance the cinematic experience The film is the central focus and my role is to support and elevate its narrative emotions and overall impact through music This philosophy emphasizes the importance of understanding the director s vision the story s themes and the characters journeys It means that I prioritize aligning my musical choices with the needs and intentions of the film whether it s through creating a unique musical score capturing the tone of a specific scene or enhancing the emotional resonance of pivotal moments By placing the film at the forefront I aim to create a harmonious marriage between the visuals storytelling and music where the power and impact of the film are elevated through the effective use of music 
You were nominated for an Oscar for your soundtrack to Anastasia and worked on over 100 films including Heathers Ice Age and Spielberg s West Side Story Is it challenging to tell someone else s story through your music ,Well you have to follow the film and generally it s not that complicated It s easy to see what doesn t work We all understand stories and the music needs to be in service of that story otherwise there s no point in putting in the music Film isn t even 100 years old so before 1930 there was nothing like it The people that started writing film music in the 1930s my father Alfred Newman included but also Max Steiner Franz Waxman Dimitri Tiomkin they were trying to figure out how you put music in a film when there s talking The questions they were asking themselves what is music doing Why is it there How much should it be there Those are the same questions we are still asking ourselves as composers ,David Newman,Telling someone else s story through music is indeed a fascinating and complex challenge Each film has its own unique narrative characters and emotional journey and my task as a composer is to understand and capture the essence of those elements through music It requires careful collaboration with the director and creative team to ensure that my musical choices align with their vision and enhance the storytelling I strive to delve deep into the characters motivations the thematic threads and the overall tone of the film to create a musical landscape that supports and enriches the narrative While it can be challenging to encapsulate someone else s story in music it is also an incredibly rewarding process It allows me to explore different musical styles evoke specific emotions and bring a unique perspective to each project ultimately contributing to the overall impact and resonance of the film 
Mr Oyelowo how do you approach playing a historical character ,It s a very tricky thing because of course you have to be evocative of who they were how they moved how they spoke You have to make people relax and say Okay he feels like him enough that I can just go on this journey with this character But if it becomes an imitation if it s about mimicry if all people were saying is Oh yeah he really got the voice you re dead That s the worst compliment you can pay ,David Oyelowo,When approaching the portrayal of a historical character I believe it is essential to engage in thorough research and immerse oneself in understanding the person s life context and significance within history This involves studying historical records reading biographies or memoirs and examining archival footage or photographs if available I strive to capture the essence of the individual s personality beliefs and motivations as well as the challenges and experiences they faced during their time It is important to honor the real person while also bringing my own interpretation and depth to the role Through a combination of research empathy and artistic exploration I aim to breathe life into the character allowing audiences to connect with their humanity and the impact they had on the world 
Is it important for your work to inspire people to be better ,It is important to me I want to do films that hopefully inspire people to be the best version of themselves If you look at the films I do all of them in some way the remit I set myself is How does this enrich people s lives You know what s meaningful I want films that when my kids see them they understand why daddy did those films They understand how it correlates with the way I m trying to raise them ,David Oyelowo,Yes I believe it is important for my work to inspire people to be better As an actor I see storytelling as a powerful medium to evoke emotions challenge perspectives and ignite change Through the characters I portray and the narratives I engage with I strive to illuminate the human condition explore social issues and highlight the potential for growth empathy and understanding I hope that my performances and the stories I am a part of can resonate with audiences spark conversations and encourage individuals to reflect on their own lives and the world around them Whether it s through portraying historical figures complex fictional characters or highlighting social injustices I aim to inspire empathy compassion and a desire for positive transformation 
In the last few years you ve been in The Help Lincoln The Butler and most recently you portrayed Martin Luther King Jr in Selma Why is it so important for you to make films about African American history ,We need those films Up until recently films that deal with civil rights and racial unrest have mostly been told through white characters through white protagonists Malcolm X is probably the only film I can think of where you have an indisputable black American leader as the focus of the film What you ve tended to have is Mississippi Burning or you have Glory or you have these films that are all through white protagonists Great films but a different point of view You can t have a film about Dr King and it be all about Lyndon Johnson in my opinion ,David Oyelowo,It is important for me to make films about African American history because I believe that representation and the telling of diverse stories are vital for creating a more inclusive and equitable society African American history is rich with stories of resilience courage and triumph in the face of adversity and these stories deserve to be celebrated and shared on the big screen By bringing these narratives to life we can shed light on the experiences struggles and contributions of African Americans amplifying their voices and showcasing the complexities of their journeys These films not only educate and enlighten audiences about our shared history but also provide a platform for dialogue understanding and empathy It is through the exploration and preservation of African American history that we can foster a greater appreciation for diversity and work towards a more just and inclusive future 
To quote Dr King do you believe that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice in the end ,I think it does if love is where you re operating from I think if you have anger and bitterness in your heart and you just decide to lash out against it all you do is you feed prejudice because prejudice exists on the basis that you are lesser than If you prove that you are lesser than you are only going to perpetuate that myth I think there is a reason why the phrase is moral because to be moral is to absolutely embrace the fact that there is a right and there is a wrong So the only way it bends towards justice is to be part of the solution as opposed to being part of the problem ,David Oyelowo,I do believe in the sentiment expressed by Dr King that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice in the end However I also recognize that the journey towards justice is not a passive one It requires active engagement collective effort and a commitment to dismantling systems of oppression and inequality The pursuit of justice requires constant vigilance perseverance and the courage to confront and challenge injustice wherever it may exist While progress can be slow and setbacks can occur I remain hopeful that by working together and striving for equality we can continue to push that arc towards a more just and equitable society for all 
Ms Scott as a costume designer what is it like watching an actor put on their costume and really become their character ,Oh it s absolutely a special moment I can imagine how it must have felt for Judy Garland to step into those ruby slippers for the first time It must have been like absolute magic right The costumes in The Wizard of Oz are amazing to begin with but that first time was she had to step on set in those ruby slippers must have been absolutely thrilling for everyone in the room As a costume designer it s the most gratifying thing when a costume works You have all these nerves and then when they put the costume on it s like opening night every time You ve spent all this time on it worked on every element you ve got all the approvals you need and as soon as that actor walks on set you kind of fade back You re just out of it and you can see it as a whole picture It takes your breath away ,Deborah Lynn Scott,Watching an actor put on their costume and fully embody their character is an incredibly fulfilling experience as a costume designer It is a moment where the visual elements come together to enhance the actor s transformation and bring the character to life The costume serves as a powerful tool in helping actors step into the mindset physicality and emotional depth of their characters Seeing the actor embrace the costume and embody its essence is a testament to the collaborative process between the actor the director and myself as the costume designer It s a gratifying moment that reaffirms the impact and importance of costume design in storytelling as it contributes to the overall authenticity and depth of the character s portrayal on screen 
What was it like for example seeing Michael J Fox putting on Marty McFly s orange vest for the first time in Back To The Future ,That s a funny question because obviously when you re creating it and you making those decisions you have no idea that it might become iconic So it s equally as important as what he d wear in the next scene or the previous scene you know Another example is something like Henry s red hoodie for E T these are very very simple objects I ve probably used red hoodies a dozen or more times in my career but that particular actor in that particular moment in that wonderful film is what elevates it to that position ,Deborah Lynn Scott,Seeing Michael J Fox put on Marty McFly s iconic orange vest for the first time in Back to the Future was an exhilarating moment The vest instantly became a symbol of the character and the film s timeless appeal It was a pivotal costume piece that not only reflected the 1980s aesthetic but also embodied Marty s youthful energy adventurous spirit and distinctive style Witnessing Michael fully embrace the character and bring Marty to life while wearing that vest was truly magical It solidified the connection between the actor the character and the costume and it s a moment that remains etched in my memory as a testament to the power of costume design in shaping a character s identity and leaving a lasting impression on audiences 
How does your job as a costume designer change when the film features not only motion capture performances but its final version is also in 3D ,The heart of it is always going to be the same the genesis of costume design and the intent of it is to create the character that lives in a particular place and time Your job is the same no matter what the technical side of it looks like So with Avatar The Way of Water we were thinking about clans and family and how the new societies we encounter in the film work and live Working with CGI and motion capture however we had to build the costumes to human scale so that we could put them on the actors because the clothing always informs how you move and carry yourself They needed to feel the weight of the costumes so they would know how to walk or swim in them Kate Winslet for example wears this skirt and we had to make a duplicate so she would know how it falls when she squatted down or walks For other characters who had long hair or braids they had to learn how to move it realistically in motion capture And then all of this is sent down the digital pipeline ,Deborah Lynn Scott,Designing costumes for films that feature motion capture performances and have a final version in 3D presents unique challenges and considerations In these cases the costume design must not only fulfill its traditional role of enhancing character and storytelling but also account for the technical requirements of motion capture and the visual impact of 3D presentation The costumes need to be designed with careful attention to detail ensuring they are motion friendly comfortable and able to capture the necessary movement data Additionally the costumes must be visually compelling and distinct taking into account how they will be perceived in three dimensional space Colors textures and patterns may need to be adjusted to optimize their appearance in the 3D format creating depth and enhancing the overall visual experience Collaborating closely with the film s director visual effects team and other key creatives becomes crucial in navigating these technical considerations while maintaining the artistic integrity of the costume design 
What is it like to see your costumes brought to life digitally ,It is different It s so deeply visual They have a different magic being on the screen because you re drawn into that movie As an audience member you re so sucked into the world and you feel like you re standing next to them practically But I also really believe that the costumes on a mannequin are stunning as well so there is equal cards ,Deborah Lynn Scott,Seeing my costumes brought to life digitally is both fascinating and gratifying It s a testament to the advancements in technology and the collaboration between various creative departments When costumes are digitally rendered or enhanced it allows for a level of detail and visual impact that may not have been achievable solely through traditional costume construction Seeing the textures colors and intricate design elements come to life digitally adds another layer of depth and immersion to the characters and the overall visual experience It s an exciting moment to witness how the combination of physical costumes and digital enhancements can elevate the storytelling and create a captivating on screen presence for the characters It reinforces the collaborative nature of filmmaking and highlights the incredible possibilities that arise when different artistic disciplines merge together seamlessly 
Ms Landis as a costume designer would you say your work has a signature look or style ,Signatures are a tricky thing Costume design unlike what the audience may think is more about the conversation than about clothes It s really about trying to discover who the people are in the story We create fictional personalities from text we have to find the beating heart of the people in the text and create with the actors real authentic individuals How do you start to do that The most iconic costumes were created from research and deep discussions about the text with the director So I always hope that I serve the text and the director completely In terms of a specific signature I would say that I use silhouettes to great effect ,Deborah Landis,As a costume designer I would say that my work doesn t necessarily have a signature look or style that can be easily defined I approach each project with a deep appreciation for the story characters and historical context allowing those elements to guide my design choices I strive to create costumes that are authentic visually compelling and enhance the narrative and character development This often involves extensive research attention to detail and collaboration with the director and other creative team members My work spans various genres time periods and aesthetics from period dramas to contemporary films and even comedies Each project presents unique opportunities to explore different visual languages and styles while always prioritizing the storytelling and the individual needs of the characters Ultimately I aim to create costumes that are memorable impactful and integral to the overall cinematic experience rather than adhering to a specific signature look or style 
Do the costumes look different for better or worse in real life than they do in the films ,Well that s a big question because we are in a theatrical career We re big liars I mean very very rarely do we use real diamonds we partner with Swarovski Our role is really to create authentic characters but we do so with a lot of magic And so it really doesn t have to be cashmere it just has to look like cashmere It doesn t have to be gold it just has to really look like gold We have to believe it We re cheaters we re liars in that way There s a wonderful costume designer named James Atchison who won an Academy Award for a movie with Robert Downey Jr Called Restoration which is about Louis XIV And when I saw his costumes in person I was absolutely shocked to see that all of the beautiful embroidery was made with puff paint It looked exactly like gold embroidery ,Deborah Landis,Costumes can sometimes appear different in real life compared to how they are perceived on screen The way costumes are designed constructed and tailored takes into account various factors including the lighting camera angles and overall visual style of the film When seen in person without the cinematic elements the costumes may not have the same impact or presence Additionally the filmmaking process often involves post production editing color grading and visual effects that can further alter the appearance of costumes However it s important to note that the design and construction of the costumes remain the same and they are still crafted with meticulous attention to detail and authenticity The differences in perception between real life and on screen presentation are more a result of the cinematic techniques and visual storytelling choices rather than any shortcomings in the costume design itself 
Is it true that Hollywood has been notoriously bad at preserving and archiving film costumes accessories and even the illustrations and designs ,It s true Hollywood as a industry was always about what s next So once you released your movie and you ve seen what the box office made of that film you move on to the next one the next opening the next Oscar campaign Warner Brothers didn t even start the archiving of anything until the 1990s All the studios saw was that it was very costly to store old clothes that they were not going to be using so of course costumes became the original recycleables We were constantly cutting off sleeves shortening dresses dyeing clothes that had been used on other movies remaking pieces ,Deborah Landis,It is true that historically the preservation and archiving of film costumes accessories illustrations and designs have not always been given the attention they deserve in Hollywood While there have been efforts to preserve significant pieces of cinematic history there have also been instances where costumes and related materials have been neglected or lost over time However it is worth noting that in recent years there has been an increased recognition of the importance of preserving these artifacts not only for their historical value but also as a means to study and appreciate the artistry behind costume design Organizations museums and dedicated professionals are working to improve the preservation and archiving practices ensuring that these invaluable pieces of film history are safeguarded for future generations It remains an ongoing effort to raise awareness and allocate resources towards preserving this aspect of the film industry s legacy 
Ms Gough do you think about the audience when you re acting on stage ,Sometimes you know for People Places Things which is about addiction we made sure that there were a lot of recovery people that we worked with and that those people would also come and see it They re our critics When we ran that play at the National one of the recovery people who had been helping us was in the audience When I did the scene where my character picks up the phone to go to a meeting he shouted Good girl And I just burst into tears on stage I had to take a moment because I thought It doesn t matter what anyone says about this play That person feels represented And that s all that mattered So there is a part of my ego and my fear that comes out but I try to think to myself I have to keep it really simple ,Denise Gough,When I am acting on stage I do think about the audience but not in a way that compromises the authenticity of my performance I believe that theater is a collaborative art form and the audience plays an essential role in that collaboration Their presence and energy in the theater can be a source of inspiration and fuel for my performance However my primary focus is on fully embodying and conveying the truth of the character and the story I strive to create a genuine connection with my fellow actors on stage and in doing so I trust that the audience will be drawn into the world we are creating and engage with the emotional journey we are portraying Ultimately my aim is to create an immersive and impactful experience for the audience where they can connect with the humanity and the story unfolding before them

What did you think of London as a 16 year old ,As a 16 year old Irish Catholic girl it was sensational Parties went on until nine o clock in the morning on a Tuesday I mean it was amazing And it was really difficult too but it was completely the making of me It kicked the shit out of me for a long time but then when it opens its arms it s fantastic When I think now of all this immigration talk and people coming here I m an immigrant It s just I m a white English speaking one so I m allowed to be in magazines and stuff But this country gave me everything I was on the dole I have the NHS I had council tax paid I had housing and benefits I had a scholarship to drama school I am a product of pouring stuff into an immigrant and seeing that kind of pay off ,Denise Gough,When I was 16 years old I found London to be a vibrant and exciting city Coming from a smaller town London offered a whole new world of opportunities diversity and cultural experiences I was captivated by its bustling energy rich history and the sense of endless possibilities that it held As a young person with dreams of pursuing a career in the arts London felt like the epicenter of creativity and artistic expression I was drawn to its theaters galleries and the vibrant artistic community that thrived within its streets It was an inspiring and formative time in my life and London played a significant role in shaping my passion for the performing arts 
Were you ever worried that your acting career wouldn t work out ,I didn t really have an option to fall back on so the acting thing had to work I had a lot of had teachers along the way that believed in me At drama school it felt like exactly the right place for me I must have been a pain in the arse for people because I was so into theater I think I was probably quite frightening They cast me as Irina in Three Sisters and I was like You ve got to be kidding me I m not playing her I don t care I want to be Natasha And then I shaved all my hair off And then they were like Okay you can play Natasha Brilliant Okay so that s all I had to do is ,Denise Gough,Like many actors I have experienced moments of doubt and uncertainty about the trajectory of my acting career It is natural to have concerns and fears about the unpredictable nature of the industry and the challenges that come with pursuing a creative profession There were times when I questioned whether I would be able to achieve my goals and sustain a successful career in acting However I have always been driven by a deep passion for the craft and a belief in my own abilities I embraced those moments of uncertainty as opportunities for growth and self reflection I persevered through setbacks and rejections constantly honing my skills and seeking out new opportunities Ultimately my determination and love for acting helped me overcome any doubts and forge ahead on my path leading me to the fulfilling and rewarding career I have today

What about the years after The Last Movie when you had difficulty financing any of your projects ,I think later when one is not allowed to work and can t get jobs or writes screenplays and no one will give you financing then the drugs and alcohol are no longer about the work They are about wallowing in self pity and anger that s a different story ,Dennis Lee Hopper,The years following the release of The Last Movie were indeed challenging in terms of financing my projects The film s reception and commercial performance created a difficult climate for me as a director seeking financial support for future endeavors I encountered resistance and skepticism from studios and financiers which made it difficult to secure funding for my projects This period of struggle and financial instability was undoubtedly discouraging but it also presented an opportunity for me to reassess my approach to filmmaking and explore alternative avenues for creative expression Despite the difficulties I never lost my passion for storytelling and filmmaking I persevered seeking independent financing and embracing smaller scale projects that allowed me to continue pursuing my artistic vision It was a period of growth and resilience and while the financial challenges were significant they also pushed me to find new ways to bring my creative ideas to life 
Is it true that Wim Wenders helped you step away from drugs ,I came from Apocalypse Now to do The American Friend with Wim and when I came out of the jungles in the Philippines Wim described me as having jungle sores all over my body So he gave me a haircut and put me in a homburg It was like being in a blizzard you re lost you re going to die and suddenly this St Bernard dog called Wim comes with cognac around his neck and saves your life And that s the way I felt about the situation at the time ,Dennis Lee Hopper,Yes it is true that Wim Wenders played a significant role in helping me confront and overcome my struggles with substance abuse During the making of The American Friend Wim Wenders became a close friend and collaborator He witnessed firsthand the destructive impact that drugs were having on my life and recognized the need for intervention Wim Wenders along with other friends and loved ones supported and encouraged me to seek help and make positive changes in my life Their unwavering support combined with my own determination led me on a path towards recovery and sobriety I am deeply grateful for Wim Wenders friendship and his role in helping me navigate those challenging times His influence and support were instrumental in my journey towards healing and finding a healthier and more fulfilling path 
Mr Washington do you enjoy playing the bad guy ,As an actor in the theater you re taught that you never play a bad guy You have to love who you are You can t say Oh I m a bad guy How do you play that ,Denzel Washington,I wouldn t say that I necessarily enjoy playing the bad guy but I do appreciate the opportunity to portray complex and morally ambiguous characters As an actor I am drawn to roles that challenge me and allow me to explore the depths of human nature These characters often have layers of darkness flaws and internal conflicts which can be both compelling and rewarding to delve into It is not about glorifying or relishing in villainous roles but rather about bringing depth authenticity and understanding to those characters Ultimately I strive to humanize even the most flawed and morally ambiguous characters as I believe it allows for a richer exploration of the human experience and storytelling 
Do you often have to turn down roles because they typecast you ,Absolutely My career is based on saying no Sidney Poitier told me many many years ago that the first four or five movies that you do will determine how you re perceived in the business So I was very blessed that the second movie I did was with Norman Jewison the third movie I did was with Sidney Lumet and the fourth movie I did was Cry Freedom with Richard Attenborough for which I was nominated for the first time I was off to the races There were other movies that I could have done and I didn t do ,Denzel Washington,As an actor I strive to choose roles that challenge me and offer opportunities for growth and artistic exploration While it is true that there have been instances where I have had to turn down certain roles due to concerns of being typecast I am fortunate to have been able to work on a diverse range of projects throughout my career It is important for me to avoid being confined to a specific type of character or genre as I believe in the power of versatility and embracing different storytelling experiences By seeking out diverse roles and collaborating with a variety of talented filmmakers I aim to continuously expand my range as an actor and avoid being limited by any preconceived notions or expectations 
You also trained in the theater before you made it as a big Hollywood star right ,Well I m not a big Hollywood star I m an actor I m called a star That s not what I am First of all I m a human being my profession is acting People give you titles They say you re an up and coming star then they say you re a star then they say you re a washed up star So I don t get caught up in what I m called My job my profession is acting ,Denzel Washington,Yes that s correct Before achieving success in Hollywood I received formal training in theater I studied drama at Fordham University and later pursued a Master of Fine Arts degree at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco My theater training provided a solid foundation for my acting career and allowed me to develop a deep appreciation for the craft It instilled in me a love for the stage and a commitment to honing my skills as an actor The discipline and techniques I learned in the theater have continued to influence and shape my approach to acting in film as well Theater remains a significant part of my artistic journey and I have returned to the stage at various points in my career to further challenge myself and explore new dimensions of my craft 
Do you think the studio system gives black actors enough chances to play leading roles ,Well I don t even know what the studio system is first of all I don t think there is a system It s a bunch of people scrambling trying to get rich That s all it is There s no committee that sits around and goes This is the system It s like Hey if Joe Black suddenly makes us 100 million find me 10 more Joe Blacks I think that s the nature of the business I think that the business is toughest on women white or black ,Denzel Washington,The issue of representation and opportunities for black actors in the industry is an ongoing conversation that needs continued attention While progress has been made there is still work to be done to ensure equal opportunities for actors of all backgrounds The studio system like any other aspect of the industry can play a significant role in shaping these opportunities It is important for studios to recognize and embrace the diversity of talent and stories that exist providing platforms for underrepresented voices to be heard and celebrated By actively seeking out and supporting diverse projects and talent the industry can contribute to a more inclusive and representative landscape Ultimately it is a collective effort involving filmmakers producers studios and audiences to advocate for increased diversity and create a more equitable playing field for all actors 
Ms Kruger do you have a go to person for advice ,Yes I do I go to therapy That s helped me a lot ,Diane Heidkrüger,Yes I am fortunate to have a few go to people in my life whom I trust and seek advice from While I value the perspectives of my family and close friends I also have a circle of trusted mentors within the industry These individuals who have more experience and wisdom in navigating the entertainment world provide valuable guidance and support They have been through similar situations and understand the challenges and nuances of the industry Having a trusted confidant or mentor to turn to for advice and guidance can be incredibly beneficial in making important decisions and navigating the complexities of my career Their insights and wisdom have been invaluable to me and I am grateful for their presence in my life 
When you were growing up there was so much said about the method and DeNiro and that style of acting Did you feel like you had to do that ,No There s always been two schools about that I think Jack Nicholson said It s called acting You know switch it on and off I don t know if I m able to completely switch it off sometimes But I really really try I went to the method acting class for a day and they asked me to be an artichoke And I was like I don t think I can ever use that Then I went to Le Cours Florent which is a very old theater school in France and I studied Victor Hugo and the old old school stuff It prepares you to be on stage to be looked at and all those things that are awkward when you re in front of a camera for the first little while ,Diane Heidkrüger,Growing up I certainly heard a lot about the method acting approach and the work of actors like Robert De Niro While I deeply admire their dedication and commitment to their craft I never felt pressured to adopt a specific acting technique or emulate anyone else s style Every actor has their own unique approach to their work and I believe in finding what works best for me as an individual I strive to be truthful and authentic in my performances exploring the depths of my characters and connecting with their emotions in a way that feels genuine to me Acting is a deeply personal and individual journey and I embrace the freedom to discover my own process and interpret characters in my own way 
Have you ever been camera shy ,Oh of course My first movie I was trying to hide from the camera I think it s human to not want to expose yourself If you have to cry you don t want everybody to look at you you know Obviously you know you re playing for the camera but it s like you instinctively hold your hands in front of your face or something But you learn through other actors My first movie was with Dennis Hopper and he literally was like You re the greenest person I ve ever seen And he taught me everything ,Diane Heidkrüger,I wouldn t say I have ever been camera shy per se but like any actor there have been moments of nervousness or self awareness when working in front of the camera It s natural to have a level of self consciousness when you know you re being watched and recorded However over the years and with experience I have learned to embrace the camera as a tool and a partner in storytelling I have become more comfortable and confident in front of the camera allowing myself to fully immerse into the characters and the world of the film Ultimately it s about finding a balance between being aware of the camera and staying present in the moment allowing the magic of storytelling to unfold 
Do you think that will be different for the next generation of actors who have grown up with smartphones and social media They are constantly performing for the camera in a way ,Maybe It s hard to tell but I think so Most people meet on Tinder right I was at a premiere recently and an actor that was in the movie brought his girlfriend I was a little drunk and I was like Oh how d you two meet And they were like On Tinder And I was like What I thought you only have sex on Tinder I didn t know you actually date I m so behind ,Diane Heidkrüger,It s true that the rise of smartphones and social media has created a different landscape for the next generation of actors With constant access to cameras and the ability to document and share their lives on various platforms there is a certain level of performance and self presentation that comes into play This can have both positive and negative impacts on young actors On one hand it provides them with a platform to showcase their talent and connect with audiences in new and exciting ways On the other hand it can also create pressure to constantly be on and maintain a curated image which may affect their ability to fully immerse into characters and engage in more traditional forms of storytelling It will be interesting to see how this evolving digital landscape shapes the way actors approach their craft and navigate their careers in the future 
Do you feel like you can be more bold now also in the roles you choose as an actress ,Yeah as I get older and have more experiences in life I m able to bring more to a role you know I am unafraid to ask for the things that I need to be able to perform too You learn that you have to speak up for yourself If I work it s because I chose it and it s a pleasure and I believe in what I m doing ,Diane Heidkrüger,Yes I do feel that as I have grown as an actress and gained more experience I have become more confident and bold in the roles I choose I have always been drawn to complex and challenging characters but as I have evolved in my craft I am more willing to take risks and explore different genres and narratives I believe that pushing boundaries and stepping outside of my comfort zone allows for growth and keeps the creative journey exciting and fulfilling I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with visionary directors and collaborate on projects that allow me to delve into diverse and thought provoking roles As an artist I am constantly seeking new challenges and ways to stretch my artistic abilities and I look forward to continuing to take on bold and compelling roles that inspire and captivate both myself and audiences 
Do you ever choose roles because you want to comment on world affairs ,I don t think I choose roles because I want to comment But I think as a citizen of the world I m concerned with what s happening in our world right So if I read a script that talks about certain things chances are I might be interested in that I m not sure that I want to make a personal political statement or comment on something I m not sure that s my role as an actor I m just there to tell the story But I know that as an audience I like films that have multiple layers But for example when I made a film about Marie Antoinette people in France are so split about whether she was a goddess or the worst person ever I never ever told anyone my personal point of view ,Diane Heidkrüger,As an actress I am deeply passionate about storytelling and its ability to shed light on important social and world affairs While I don t exclusively choose roles with the intention of commenting on specific world issues I am drawn to projects that tackle relevant and thought provoking subjects I believe that films have the power to generate conversations raise awareness and spark change Whether it s a character who embodies resilience fights for justice or represents a particular historical event or social issue I am interested in stories that have a meaningful impact and resonate with audiences on a broader level It is a privilege to be part of projects that have the potential to contribute to the collective dialogue and inspire viewers to reflect on and engage with the world around them 
Ms Lane would you ever consider leaving the United States and living somewhere else ,I think it s hard to leave what you grew up knowing and identifying with Honestly I think it would be harder to leave it now when I feel like every person needs to do what they can to support the health of our country It s easy to run away when somebody is weak and sick and failing It s like It s been great and thanks for all the good times This country needs every person to care and show up and vote and petition and express their vision for rather than letting it get taken over by the loudest voices It s an interesting time of history so I feel like I have to stay even though I sometimes feel like a hostage But I speak French and I love Italy Germany The Netherlands Switzerland The scale of Europe is so interesting It s definitely humbling to travel ,Diane Lane,While I have a deep love and appreciation for my home country I believe that life is full of possibilities and opportunities for exploration As an actress I have been fortunate enough to travel and work in various parts of the world which has allowed me to experience different cultures and perspectives The idea of living in another country is certainly intriguing and I am open to the idea of immersing myself in a new environment if the right circumstances and opportunities present themselves However my connection to the United States and my career ties me to this country and I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have had here Ultimately the decision to live elsewhere would depend on various factors including personal circumstances professional opportunities and the overall experience and opportunities that a different country may offer 
Mr Cheadle have you been able to meet many of your heroes ,Oh God don t meet your heroes just keep them over there That way you can have a good opinion of them and you don t have to see them cuss out some kids and think Oh fuck dude I have to hate you now But I am a single digit golfer and one of the perks of the job is getting to play in these Pro ams getting to be inside the ropes and walk around with these guys and exchange numbers and hang out When David Feherty is announcing and has his phone with him we d play Stump the Fart He calls himself the fart So I like to send him things that I think are impossible for him to say during a golf broadcast and see if he can say it ,Donald Cheadle,Over the course of my career I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to meet and work with many incredible individuals who I admire and consider as heroes in their respective fields From esteemed actors and filmmakers to activists and artists I have had the privilege of crossing paths with some truly inspiring people These encounters have been both humbling and inspiring as they have allowed me to learn from and be influenced by individuals who have made a significant impact in their respective industries Whether it s collaborating with fellow actors whose work I have long admired or meeting individuals who have dedicated their lives to making a positive change in the world these experiences have enriched my own journey as an artist and human being 
You ve been in your fair share of Hollywood blockbusters by now so I can imagine you have a lot of stories like that What do you take away from those experiences ,Money No it s a different experience It s fantastical and big personally it s fun to go back and see those guys every year or so Our business is just by nature very nomadic but it s been great to make friends in that space and then to come back it every once in a while and be in these movies and hang off walls and do stunts and just do big fun shit ,Donald Cheadle,Being part of Hollywood blockbusters has been a unique and exciting experience for me While these films often come with large scale productions and significant exposure what I take away from those experiences extends beyond the glitz and glamour Working on such projects has allowed me to collaborate with incredibly talented individuals both in front of and behind the camera I have learned from seasoned actors esteemed directors and dedicated crew members gaining valuable insights and expanding my artistic horizons Additionally these films have provided me with a platform to connect with audiences on a global scale and tell stories that have the potential to entertain inspire and spark meaningful conversations Ultimately the takeaway from these experiences is the knowledge that filmmaking is a collaborative art form and every project contributes to my growth as an actor and as a storyteller 
The Ocean s trilogy starts off in Vegas with a casino heist setting things in motion I hear that you re actually quite the poker player Does acting help you when you need a poker face ,I don t think so I think the only thing that helps you with poker is being able to play poker It s not just rolling the dice and praying ,Donald Cheadle,Acting definitely helps when it comes to maintaining a poker face at the poker table As an actor one of the key skills we develop is the ability to control our facial expressions body language and emotions This skill set can certainly come in handy during a game of poker where maintaining a calm and composed demeanor is crucial Acting has taught me to be observant to read people s reactions and to understand the power of non verbal communication These skills can be advantageous in the game of poker where bluffing and strategic decision making play a significant role While my passion for poker goes beyond just the acting connection the skills I ve developed as an actor have certainly enhanced my enjoyment and understanding of the game 
You used to play poker to raise money for charity right Isn t that a bit incongruous ,You know they asked John Dillinger why he robbed banks and he said Because that is where the money is It s just fun to play in a tournament We raised over 4 million for Africa so we were very fortunate It was during the heyday of the game so it would be trickier to do now That said I do have a charity tournament in a couple of weeks coming up ,Donald Cheadle,Playing poker to raise money for charity may seem incongruous at first glance but it s actually a great way to combine my love for the game with a meaningful cause Poker tournaments and events can be organized as fundraisers where participants contribute to charitable organizations or causes It s an opportunity to use the platform and popularity of poker to bring attention to important issues and make a positive impact While poker is often associated with competition and gambling when played in a charitable context it becomes a means to support and give back to the community It s a way to harness the enthusiasm for the game and turn it into something that benefits others So while poker and charity may seem like an unlikely pairing they can actually work together to make a difference and raise much needed funds for worthy causes 
You seem very concerned with doing your part to make the world a better place Do you feel that films should educate viewers ,Well first off an audience member needs to be aware that a filmmaker for the most part in a movie is not attempting to educate you They are attempting to give you an experience that will have you wanting to come back and bring 10 more friends I think that it s a risky prospect to believe that going to a movie in some way shape or form is going to give you a good education about the subject matter ,Donald Cheadle,Films have a unique ability to entertain inspire and educate viewers They can serve as powerful tools for raising awareness promoting empathy and sparking important conversations about various social and global issues While not all films are explicitly educational in nature they have the potential to offer insights into different perspectives shed light on historical events or address societal challenges Films can create a bridge between cultures promote understanding and encourage viewers to critically examine the world around them As an actor I believe in the power of storytelling to provoke thought evoke emotions and drive positive change Whether it s through thought provoking narratives authentic portrayals of diverse experiences or shedding light on important social issues films have the capacity to educate and inspire audiences in impactful ways However it s ultimately up to individual filmmakers to decide the extent to which they want their work to carry an educational element 
Mr Johnson you ve appeared in countless films over the course of your career and you re often called the hardest working man in Hollywood Are you happiest when you re working ,I enjoy working I enjoy building I have a little philosophy that I enjoy putting in the work with my own two hands I like saying that Making a movie and producing a movie especially one that you are lucky enough to star in comes with a great deal of joy an incredible amount of hard work and equal amounts of stress pressure fun and anxiety But ultimately it s extremely rewarding I have the best job in the world ,Dwayne Johnson,I definitely find a great sense of fulfillment and joy when I m working on projects that I m passionate about I genuinely love what I do and I feel incredibly grateful for the opportunities I ve had in my career Being on set collaborating with talented individuals and bringing characters to life is a thrilling and fulfilling experience for me However I also value and prioritize other aspects of my life such as spending time with my family pursuing personal interests and taking care of my overall well being It s all about finding a balance and ensuring that I m not solely defined by my work Happiness for me comes from having a fulfilling career but also from the relationships I have the experiences I cherish and the personal growth I continue to pursue 
How do you decide when to say yes to a film project and when it might be too stressful for you ,Well the appealing things about making for example Red Notice were the following the opportunity to make a movie that was fun globetrotting working with my friends Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot Rawson Thurber the director this was our third movie together and I loved that this was stylistic and different with a really cool twist Creating a movie that hundreds of millions of people will see on opening weekend thanks to Netflix of course the idea of that is pretty exciting ,Dwayne Johnson,Deciding which film projects to take on is a combination of several factors for me First and foremost I look at the story and the character I want to be part of projects that have an engaging and meaningful narrative ones that can entertain audiences and resonate with them on some level Additionally I consider the creative team involved including the director and fellow cast members Collaboration is key and working with talented and passionate individuals can enhance the overall experience I also assess the potential impact and reach of the project Is it something that can make a difference or connect with a wide audience Lastly I consider the logistics and feasibility of the project as well as how it fits into my overall schedule and personal commitments Stress is a natural part of the filmmaking process but I try to find a balance between challenging myself and maintaining my well being If I feel that a project might be too overwhelming or detrimental to my overall health and happiness I carefully evaluate whether it s the right fit for me at that particular time 
Do you ever think about slowing down ,I will tell you as I get a little older I start to realize more and more how important balance is how important mindfulness is And I really try to practice that with all the things that I have going on I think that has allowed me to bring in a lot more people who are smarter and better than me at what they do so they can help push the businesses along ,Dwayne Johnson,As an individual who enjoys staying active and constantly challenging myself I don t foresee slowing down completely However I do believe in finding a healthy balance in life It s important to take breaks recharge and prioritize self care Over the years I ve learned the importance of pacing myself and listening to my body and mind While I may continue to pursue exciting projects and new ventures I also make sure to allocate time for rest quality time with my loved ones and pursuing personal interests outside of work It s about finding that equilibrium where I can continue to do what I love while also taking care of my well being So while I may not be looking to slow down in terms of my passion for work I do strive to maintain a balanced and fulfilling life overall 
Is it also important to share the bad stuff the failures You ve been very open about your road to success coming from football when you had nothing but seven dollars in your pocket ,Yeah that was in 1995 and that will always serve as my north star and drive for sure I think we all go through our seven bucks moments and I remember thinking at that time that I was tired of being broke and I would do anything to change my situation to help and take care of my family The only thing that I could do was control my effort and put in the work with my own two hands Sharing those kinds of lessons the harder times and the times where you do get your ass kicked the times you don t win job loss life loss love loss It s important to share some of that too being in my position especially the lessons that that may help a few people along the way ,Dwayne Johnson,Absolutely I believe it s important to share both the successes and failures in life Being open and honest about the challenges we face helps to humanize our experiences and allows others to relate to us on a deeper level Failure is an inevitable part of any journey and it s through those setbacks that we learn grow and ultimately find the strength to persevere By sharing our failures we can inspire others to keep going even in the face of adversity My own personal experiences including the struggles I faced during my transition from football to entertainment have shaped me and given me a unique perspective on resilience and determination I believe that by sharing these stories we can encourage others to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams even when the odds seem stacked against them 
Mr Wright would you describe yourself as a cinephile ,Of course I m a movie fan Where I grew up in the countryside was very quiet and there was not really a lot to do My parents didn t have a VCR they sort of refused to buy one But there was a cinema around the corner from our house and that was good You could go as a child and only pay like a pound So there was several summers where I d watch the same movie I don t know how many times I saw Back to the Future the summer it came out At least five ,Edgar Wright,Absolutely I would definitely describe myself as a cinephile I have always had a deep passion and love for cinema Since a young age I have been fascinated by movies their storytelling power and the way they can transport audiences to different worlds I have always sought inspiration from a wide range of films and filmmakers both classic and contemporary I am constantly watching movies studying their techniques and exploring different genres and styles Being a cinephile not only influences my work as a filmmaker but also shapes my worldview and understanding of storytelling It s an integral part of who I am and what I do 
When did that fascination of films transition into actually wanting to make films yourself ,It was when I was 14 I knew that I wanted to do something in movies but obviously I live in in the country in the West of England so it s not something that I thought was an achievable goal I didn t know anyone from the film industry I had no in whatsoever But my parents were very encouraging towards me and my brother to sort of just follow our creative ambitions Like if you went to a careers officer at school and said I want to be a film director they d say Yeah okay sure But my mum and dad would never say No you can t They bought me and my brother a Super Eight camera when I was 14 and we started sort of messing about with that And around the same time there was a documentary on TV in Britain called The Incredibly Strange Film Show ,Edgar Wright,The transition from being a film enthusiast to wanting to make films myself happened at a relatively young age Growing up I was captivated by the power of cinema and the impact it could have on an audience I started experimenting with filmmaking in my teenage years making short films with my friends and exploring different storytelling techniques As I delved deeper into the craft my passion for filmmaking grew stronger and I realized that I wanted to pursue it as a career It was a gradual process of learning and honing my skills but the desire to create and tell stories through the medium of film was always there Eventually I took the leap and pursued my dream of becoming a filmmaker and I haven t looked back since 
Is that the kind of homework you re doing when creating a film Do you watch movies to get inspired ,In the case of Soho I did watch a lot of British dramas from the time things that were important in terms of a grounding in the social life or getting to know the cultural landscape If it s helpful for the cast and crew I can recommend things to listen or read or watch but again it s not required I m not dictating anybody it s just extra curricular stuff ,Edgar Wright,Absolutely watching movies is a crucial part of my creative process when working on a film I consider it a form of homework and an essential source of inspiration Watching films allows me to explore different storytelling techniques visual styles and narrative structures It helps me understand the language of cinema and learn from the work of other talented filmmakers I draw inspiration from a wide range of movies spanning various genres and eras as each film offers unique perspectives and ideas It s fascinating to see how other filmmakers have approached similar themes or challenges that I may be facing in my own work This process of watching and studying films helps me expand my creative palette and refine my own storytelling approach 
Do you think it s possible to be a good filmmaker who doesn t watch many films at all ,Absolutely I think it s one of those things it s like art you can do it however you want to do it I m sure Ken Loach doesn t watch many if he even does watch other movies I find myself inspired by film as an art form but that doesn t mean that your entry level to being a director is that you have to have seen all of the BFI Top 100 I d only seen 75 percent of them until recently and I ve only seen them all now because there was a global pandemic I happen to like watching movies I like diverse stuff from all over the world any sort of decade But I definitely think you can do whatever you want to do in the field ,Edgar Wright,While it is possible for someone to be a filmmaker without watching many films I believe that being well versed in the history and language of cinema greatly enhances one s abilities as a filmmaker Watching films provides exposure to different storytelling techniques visual styles and narrative structures allowing filmmakers to learn from the work of others and expand their creative horizons It helps cultivate a deeper understanding of the medium and the ability to effectively communicate through visuals and storytelling However creativity and talent can manifest in various ways and there may be filmmakers who have a unique perspective and approach that is not heavily influenced by cinematic references Ultimately the most important factor is the passion dedication and personal vision that a filmmaker brings to their craft 
Mr Berger although your film style is diverse would you say you have a signature ,Perhaps what my films have in common is that I m always looking for a challenge And above all I m always somehow subjective about the characters That started with Jack where the camera was really only on the boy s face because I didn t want to give the audience any choice but to identify with him There were no wide shots that allowed you to get away from him no counter shots on other characters at most a pan to show what he s seeing or who he s talking to If you are consistent in that the audience ends up having no choice but to go along with this boy ,Edward Berger,While I strive to approach each film with a unique vision and adapt my style to serve the story there are certain thematic and visual elements that may be present across my work which can be considered my signature I am drawn to stories that explore human emotions and the complexities of relationships often delving into the depths of characters inner lives Visually I am interested in creating immersive experiences for the audience utilizing cinematography production design and editing techniques to enhance the storytelling However I also believe in the importance of versatility as a filmmaker and I am always open to exploring different genres and styles to best serve the narratives I am working on 
Unlike many of your German peers you also did some of your studies in America Has that helped give you an edge with international audiences ,At least that s what I aspire to I like the American way very much When I visited a university friend of mine he had a 100 year old photo of a man with a spade and a covered wagon on his mantelpiece he told me it was his great grandfather going west This myth of the pioneer setting out into the unknown still lives on in the American spirit today My grandfather on the other hand is shown in photos in a suit in front of a centuries old house in Vienna It s emblematic of conservatism of holding on to old values and preserving not of looking forward Of course I m European and would like to continue living here But I like this American spirit of departure that kind of positive thinking that anything is possible ,Edward Berger,Studying in America certainly broadened my perspective and exposed me to different approaches to filmmaking It allowed me to understand the nuances of storytelling and filmmaking techniques from a global standpoint The experience helped me gain insights into the preferences and sensibilities of international audiences which in turn influenced my approach to storytelling and directing It gave me the opportunity to collaborate with filmmakers and artists from diverse backgrounds fostering a deeper appreciation for cultural exchange and the universal language of cinema I believe that this exposure to different perspectives and working in an international context has influenced my ability to connect with audiences beyond borders and create work that resonates on a global scale 
Mr Norton when did you realize that you re a good actor ,When I was younger I had these moments where I realized that I was relaxed enough that I was surprising myself with my spontaneity especially when it wasn t all managed and I thought This is what you should be chasing this feeling of spontaneity I can remember when I worked in the theater for a few years there were moments when I was thinking This is good this is rich we re finding a lot in it I can feel that it is having an impact ,Edward Norton,I don t think there was a specific moment when I realized I was a good actor It s a journey of continuous growth and learning Throughout my career I ve had the privilege of working with incredibly talented actors directors and crew members who have challenged and inspired me Their guidance and feedback have helped me develop my craft and gain confidence in my abilities However I still approach each role with a sense of curiosity and a desire to keep pushing myself creatively I believe that being a good actor is an ongoing process of self discovery and a willingness to take risks in order to fully inhabit the characters I portray 
Do you do a lot of preparation before each project ,Preparation is very important I start by looking at many things from clothes to music to voice I know it sounds weird but sometimes figuring out the clothes can really start to help you inhabit a character It s different every time Sometimes it s music sometimes the voice is important first ,Edward Norton,Yes I believe in thorough preparation for each project I approach my roles with a sense of dedication and commitment to understanding the character their motivations and their emotional journey This typically involves extensive research reading the script multiple times and diving deep into the background and context of the story I also like to collaborate closely with the director and fellow actors to ensure a shared understanding of the characters and the overall vision of the project Additionally I may engage in physical training learn new skills or accents and immerse myself in the world of the story to bring authenticity and depth to my performances Preparation is crucial in order to fully inhabit a character and deliver a nuanced and truthful portrayal on screen 
Do you ever get concerned when your films don t get as widely distributed as you d like ,No no I have always made films out of the same impulses In the past couple years I have made a few more that were in a more independent model But for example The Illusionist never got any distribution and it did really really well If you let that be your yardstick you can get wound very very tight I have had enough experiences ,Edward Norton,Certainly as an actor and filmmaker I always hope that my films reach a wide audience and have a meaningful impact When a film I ve worked on doesn t receive the level of distribution or attention that I may have hoped for it can be disappointing However I also understand that the film industry is complex and unpredictable and there are many factors that contribute to a film s distribution and reception Ultimately my focus remains on the creative process and the opportunity to collaborate with talented artists to bring stories to life While it s natural to desire broader recognition I try to stay grounded and remember that the most important aspect is the art itself and the joy of creating something meaningful 
Mr Wood does your process change from role to role ,I think my process is more or less the same with every film but it shifts and changes depending on what is required It s hard to articulate because it s not something I ever really lay out structurally I guess it s just reading the script a lot getting a strong sense of who the character is and finding that character in different ways And it s not always the same I think a sense of preparedness is pretty paramount I always want to come prepared with dialogue locked so that s not something I have to worry about on the day ,Elijah Wood,Yes my process does change from role to role Each character and project requires a unique approach and demands different levels of preparation I believe in immersing myself in the world of the character and the story and that often involves extensive research and understanding the specific nuances and motivations of the character Sometimes it requires physical transformations or learning new skills while other times it s more about delving into the emotional and psychological aspects of the character I also place a great emphasis on collaboration with the director and fellow actors as that helps shape and refine my portrayal Ultimately my goal is to bring authenticity and truth to each character I play and the process for achieving that may vary depending on the role and the project 
Are there ever moments during that process of really becoming your character that you almost forget that you re acting ,Yeah that s often referred to as the flow state where you re so invested in the moment that you re in that you re not aware of what it is that you re doing from moment to moment It s just happening right So yeah that definitely happens It s kind of wild Film acting for instance versus a theatrical acting which I ve done very little of is so different because with film acting you are extremely technical you re making all these micro decisions constantly based on where the camera is and where your marks are and hitting those marks while also being in the moment listening to the other actor responding to the other actor There s a million micro choices that are being made ,Elijah Wood,Absolutely there are moments during the process of fully immersing myself in a character where the lines between the character and myself can blur Acting is a deeply transformative and immersive experience and there are instances when I can become so absorbed in the character s emotions thoughts and behaviors that it feels as though I am no longer consciously acting These moments of total immersion are incredibly powerful and can lead to some of the most authentic and truthful performances However it s important to maintain a level of self awareness and professionalism to ensure that I can effectively collaborate with the cast and crew and fulfill my responsibilities as an actor Balancing that level of immersion with the necessary technical and creative aspects of filmmaking is a delicate dance that I navigate throughout the process 
Recently you ve had several producing credits has that also influenced the way you do your job as an actor Or are they two totally separate roles for you ,I think they re two separate things but also very tied together For a very long time I have felt at my best if I m included in the larger creative team more than just simply being an actor I love the process I love being a part of a creative team and that everyone is working towards this common creative goal And that sort of dovetailed into wanting to be a part of that creative process from an earlier stand seeing something from its inception all the way through That became increasingly exciting to me I ve really loved stepping away from being in front of the camera to working with writers and directors and just being a part of that process from a different angle Because even as an actor I m always looking for something that feels challenging something that involves getting out of my comfort zone ,Elijah Wood,Being involved in producing has definitely influenced my approach to acting in some ways It has given me a broader understanding of the filmmaking process as a whole and a deeper appreciation for the collaborative nature of the industry It has also given me a greater sense of responsibility and a desire to contribute to the overall vision of a project beyond just my performance as an actor However I still view acting and producing as distinct roles each with their own unique challenges and rewards While there may be some overlap and cross pollination of skills and insights I strive to approach each role with a focused mindset and give my full dedication to the craft of acting Ultimately both acting and producing allow me to express my creativity and passion for storytelling but they require different skill sets and perspectives 
Ms Moss are you a good liar ,I actually am not a very good liar I think a lot of actors say this and I don t know if it s because I m an actor or if it s just the way I am but when I actually do have to lie in my life I tend to become a bit of an idiot and I m not very good at it So I see myself as a pretty truthful person ,Elisabeth Moss,Well as an actor my job is to inhabit different characters and portray their truth even if it means delving into their complexities or telling stories that may not be my personal truth So in that sense I suppose you could say that I have the ability to convincingly lie on screen However in my personal life I strive to be authentic and truthful in my interactions with others Being able to convincingly portray different characters doesn t necessarily make me a good liar in the traditional sense but rather a skilled storyteller and interpreter of emotions 
What made you decide to study feminism ,Primarily because people like you ask me about it so at some point I have to come up with intelligent answers But I actually studied it for the Broadway show I was in called The Heidi Chronicles It s been like an accidental kind of education ,Elisabeth Moss,I ve always been interested in exploring complex and thought provoking themes in my work and feminism is one of those topics that has been incredibly important to me It s about advocating for equality and dismantling gender based discrimination and oppression As an actor I have a platform to bring attention to these issues and contribute to the ongoing dialogue around gender equality Studying feminism has allowed me to deepen my understanding of the challenges women face and the importance of fighting for social justice It has also influenced the roles I choose and the stories I want to tell as I strive to portray strong and empowered female characters who challenge societal norms 
Ms Olsen would you say that you grow as an actor with every project ,I do feel that way Especially right before I did WandaVision I was filming a second season of a show I made called Sorry for Your Loss It was my first time doing television and it was such a different muscle I had to reorganize how I worked because your brain really does need to work harder when you do television It s just a harder situation I felt like everything was tightened a bit and like I knew what I was doing So yes I do feel like there s a bit of a change in growth and process every year I also think there s something to be said about making the choice to commit and invest more I think I realized that maybe I was a bit lazy on some jobs in the past ,Elizabeth Olsen,Yes absolutely Each project offers unique opportunities for growth and exploration as an actor Every character I portray allows me to delve into different aspects of humanity challenge myself creatively and expand my understanding of the craft Whether it s working with different directors collaborating with talented cast members or delving into diverse genres and storytelling styles I constantly strive to push my boundaries and evolve as an actor Each project brings its own set of challenges and learning experiences contributing to my overall growth and development in this ever evolving art form 
Did working as a producer give you insight into what you need as an actor ,Yeah and now I pretend like I m a producer on everything and it s so annoying What I try and do is I want to make sure that all the actors have what they need Usually you have leaders who are capable of that but sometimes things fall through so I like being able to be present for everyone ,Elizabeth Olsen,Absolutely Working as a producer has given me a valuable perspective on the filmmaking process as a whole including the various roles and responsibilities involved It has allowed me to understand the bigger picture and appreciate the collaborative nature of filmmaking As an actor this insight has helped me to better understand and appreciate the needs of the production the director and my fellow cast and crew members It has deepened my appreciation for the entire creative process and the importance of teamwork Being involved in the production side has also given me a stronger sense of agency and creative input which I can bring to my acting work to enhance the overall quality and depth of the projects I m involved in 
Do you think you ll ever reach a point where you feel totally at ease or will that mean that you ve stayed too long in your comfort zone ,I don t know I don t know if anyone feels that way It s really vulnerable And it s scary like starting a job is always horrifying It s like the first day of school it feels terrible every time But I hope that it continues to feel that way because I like new experiences And this job really allows you to meet lots of interesting people and have lots of new experiences And I m really enjoying it ,Elizabeth Olsen,I believe that growth and evolution as an actor come from continually challenging oneself and pushing beyond the comfort zone While it s important to find a balance and feel confident in one s abilities complacency can hinder artistic growth I strive to maintain a sense of curiosity and hunger for new experiences always seeking out roles and projects that stretch me creatively and emotionally Stepping outside of my comfort zone keeps me engaged and motivated allowing me to explore different facets of my craft and discover new depths within myself as an actor So while I may find moments of ease and confidence along the way I see it as a continuous journey of pushing boundaries and embracing new challenges 
Ms Kuras what essential thing goes into the creation of a film s visual story that we as viewers might not necessarily think about ,Really good writers will be very good about pointing us or leading us down the path to the meaning that they want to create with every scene And so the challenge for cinematographers is how do you create the visual picture to be able to tell that story I ve always been very opinionated about blocking for example which is essentially how the actors move around in the set That s something you probably wouldn t think about How does this character walk into the room What s the point of view of the camera Is the camera over his shoulder or is it on the other side of the room watching him I tend to be very empathic about the way that I shoot and that inquiry really influenced how I shot Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind for instance ,Ellen Kuras,The creation of a film s visual story involves many elements that contribute to the overall cinematic experience One essential aspect that viewers might not always consider is the meticulous attention to detail and intention behind every visual choice From the composition of each frame to the use of color light and camera movement every decision is made with the goal of enhancing the storytelling and evoking specific emotions We carefully consider the visual language and symbolism to convey the themes and messages of the film Subtle visual cues such as the placement of objects or the use of certain camera angles can have a profound impact on the audience s perception and understanding of the story It is these thoughtful and deliberate visual choices that help create a unique and immersive filmic experience beyond just capturing images on screen 
Rodrigo Prieto says there must be complicity between the director and the cinematographer in order for a film to be successful Has that distinctive style ever been at odds with a director s ,The directors that I ve worked with from Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch to Sam Mendes have been very collaborative and they allowed me to bring my vision forward I actually form a vision of the film while I m reading the script for the first time and I ll often write a lot of notes on the margins of the script Then I listen to what the director has to say about their vision and try to bring my vision into it so that it works hand in hand it becomes the combination of two visions altogether Part of why that works is because I don t bring my ego into it For me it s really about the ideas I ve always brought a director s eye to what I was doing I was always asking questions about what do we want to say what does this mean how can we further enhance what we want to say in the story I ve always worked in my mind s eye ,Ellen Kuras,The collaboration between a director and a cinematographer is indeed crucial for the success of a film While each artist brings their unique style and vision to the project it is essential to find a harmonious balance and a shared understanding of the film s visual language There may be instances where a cinematographer s distinctive style may initially seem at odds with a director s vision but it is through open communication mutual respect and a willingness to collaborate that the best creative solutions are often found The key is to create a space where both the director s overall vision and the cinematographer s artistic sensibilities can coexist and enhance each other ultimately serving the story being told It is this collaborative spirit that allows for the magic of filmmaking to unfold and for the unique visual identity of a film to emerge 
How did it feel transitioning to being the director the one who dictates the core vision in 2008 for the Academy Award nominated documentary The Betrayal ,Well in the past 10 years stepping into directing full time has really taken me to a different place creatively or actually I would say deeper into my creative inquiry In a way I have become much more the filmmaker because I am in charge of everything because I get to set to tone and I get to set the vision It s become a place of strength for me in many ways The more that I do it I get to know myself better I get to know where my strengths are I get to know where I need to work on certain things ,Ellen Kuras,Transitioning to the role of director for The Betrayal was a significant shift for me It allowed me to take the reins and shape the core vision of the documentary As a cinematographer my focus had always been on capturing visuals and supporting the director s vision However with The Betrayal I had the opportunity to dive deeper into storytelling making creative decisions not only in terms of visuals but also in terms of narrative structure pacing and overall direction It was a fulfilling and challenging experience to have a more direct hand in shaping the film s narrative and emotional impact Collaborating closely with the subjects of the documentary and the rest of the creative team we worked together to bring their story to life in a way that resonated with audiences and shed light on important social issues It was a rewarding journey that allowed me to explore new facets of my creative expression and storytelling abilities 
You once said you weren t very interested in directing for television but you have recently been involved in several series Did the change of heart simply come from finding your voice in that way ,Yeah I ve always been very picky about the kind of projects that I ve done and the kind of scripts that I ve chosen to work on But I think in television the writing has changed The limited series world for instance is a place that I really like and I feel very comfortable in because you can take a topic and be able to explore it much more thoroughly that you would be able to do in a film ,Ellen Kuras,Yes my perspective on directing for television has evolved over time While I initially may have been more focused on film projects my experience working on various television series has opened my eyes to the creative possibilities and storytelling potential within the medium As I delved into these projects I discovered that television offers a unique platform for exploring complex narratives and character development over an extended period It allowed me to experiment with different visual styles and push the boundaries of storytelling Finding my voice within the realm of television has been an exciting journey and I have come to appreciate the opportunities it provides for creative expression and reaching a wider audience 
Mr Hirsch has the way you choose your film roles changed as you ve gotten older ,The thing is that as actors we have so little control over what we re offered If no one offers you movies then you can t do a movie So you get sent these scripts but you have only so much control over what options you even have So to narrow your idea of what you want to do it s tricky because you can end up setting yourself up to not doing anything So for me scripts come in and I read them and if I think it s cool I ll do it It s whatever I want to do in the moment One thing I ve noticed is that I like to work more ,Emile Hirsch,Absolutely my approach to choosing film roles has evolved over the years As I ve gained more experience and grown as an actor my priorities and considerations have shifted In my early career I was focused on exploring a diverse range of characters and challenging myself with different genres and roles However as I ve matured I ve become more selective in the projects I take on I now prioritize stories that resonate with me on a deeper level ones that allow me to delve into complex characters and explore meaningful themes I value the opportunity to work with talented filmmakers and be part of projects that have a compelling story to tell Quality and substance have become paramount in my decision making process as I strive to engage in projects that inspire and challenge me as an artist 
Do you think these smaller films have been beneficial for you as an actor in terms of developing your skills Do you get more freedom to experiment ,I don t know I guess there s as much freedom and experimentation as the director wants Experimenting is fun and I m totally down to do something like that if that s what the director wants But I also enjoy being a team player and showing up and having good dialogue you know It s still fun to just show up and say the lines as written as long as they re good lines ,Emile Hirsch,Absolutely working on smaller films has been incredibly beneficial for my growth as an actor These projects often offer more creative freedom and allow me to take on roles that may not fit within the confines of mainstream cinema In smaller productions there s often a greater emphasis on character driven storytelling and exploring complex emotions and themes This provides an opportunity for me to experiment with different approaches push my boundaries and take creative risks Additionally working with independent filmmakers and being part of intimate collaborative sets fosters a deeper level of engagement and artistic exploration It s through these experiences that I ve been able to further develop my skills and expand my range as an actor 
Do you prefer that your connection to Hollywood these days is through your work with directors like Quentin Tarantino or Sean Penn ,Do I prefer it That s a good question I don t know It sort of is what it is It s such a tricky business to consistently work in that I m pretty much just always grateful to just be working period you know And I feel like having that kind of gratitude to just be working at all is good It always keeps me showing up and excited I think what would be ultimately really toxic for an actor is if they just genuinely didn t want to be working if they don t want to be there making the movie or if they re making it for the wrong reasons ,Emile Hirsch,Working with acclaimed directors like Quentin Tarantino and Sean Penn has been a tremendous privilege and a valuable experience in my career Their unique visions and storytelling styles have allowed me to challenge myself as an actor and dive into complex and compelling characters Collaborating with such talented filmmakers not only enhances the quality of the projects but also provides an opportunity to learn from their expertise and gain valuable insights into the craft of filmmaking While I appreciate the connection to Hollywood through these collaborations I also find great fulfillment in working on a variety of projects across different genres and with diverse creative teams Ultimately it s the quality of the material and the potential for artistic growth that guides my choices as an actor 
Would you say that the films you ve worked on in the past few years have well represented the place you re in in your life ,Well considering some of the parts that played are a little shady I hope that s not too representative But you know my son is seven years old now and I do feel like being a parent definitely changes things Like the part that I played in Freaks and I play a father in Midnight in the Switchgrass and I played a father in Never Grow Old And I feel like that would have been totally different trying to play those roles because it would have been so foreign I do feel like being with being a parent It s not just about you anymore Your kid is always your priority Maybe that balances things a little bit or something Maybe that s why I am the way I am now ,Emile Hirsch,Certainly the films I ve worked on in the past few years have reflected the place I m in in my life to some extent As an actor I strive to bring authenticity and depth to the characters I portray and that often comes from drawing upon my own experiences and emotions Life is a continuous journey of growth and change and I believe that is reflected in the roles I choose and the stories I want to tell Each project offers a unique opportunity for exploration and self expression allowing me to connect with audiences on a deeper level While my personal life may influence my approach to certain roles it s also important for me to challenge myself and step into diverse and unexpected characters that stretch my abilities as an actor 
Has becoming a dad also changed your energy as an actor ,I think it s changed my energy in everything I think in terms of acting I m a bit more relaxed I m more mellow That teenage angst that can last well into your twenties I don t have that anymore It s a totally different ballgame and I m super grateful for that ,Emile Hirsch,Absolutely becoming a dad has had a profound impact on my energy as an actor Parenthood brings a whole new level of depth and understanding to my life and it naturally seeps into my work as well It has heightened my sense of responsibility and empathy allowing me to tap into a wider range of emotions and perspectives Being a father has made me more grounded and focused as I strive to set a positive example for my children both on and off the screen It has given me a greater appreciation for the preciousness of time and the importance of making meaningful connections through my performances Overall being a dad has brought a beautiful richness and purpose to my life as an actor 
Ms Stone when did you first understand the power of music ,My mom would play Les Misérables in our house when I was growing up She told me the story and then I saw it on stage when I was eight and it was transformative for me I loved it After that singing became a medium of expressing feelings that was so much bigger than just saying it ,Emily Stone,I first understood the power of music at a very young age Growing up in a household where music was always playing I was captivated by its ability to evoke emotions and create a deep connection with the listener Whether it was through the lyrics the melody or the way it made me feel I realized that music had a unique ability to transport me to different places and evoke memories and emotions It became a source of comfort inspiration and self expression As I grew older and started exploring my own musical interests I discovered the transformative impact that music can have not only on individuals but also on society as a whole It has the power to bring people together ignite change and communicate messages that words alone cannot express Music has been a constant companion throughout my life and I continue to be in awe of its ability to touch hearts and shape our experiences 
Mr Roth what have you learned about yourself through working on films ,That s a big huge question I guess I ve realized that I m more at peace than I think I am there s more of a Zen quality about things for me in some ways whether you can find that in my writing I don t know But in terms of what I ve become I have a lot of children I have a lot of grandchildren I m aware of the nature of time of people growing up When I turned 60 I started a bucket list of things that I ve not seen or experienced or had a chance to do So over the past dozen years I ve been trying to gobble up as much as I can ,Eric Roth,Through my work on films I have learned a great deal about myself The process of writing and collaborating with directors actors and the entire filmmaking team has allowed me to explore different aspects of my own creativity and storytelling abilities It has also taught me the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of challenges and setbacks Each film project presents its own unique set of obstacles and demands and navigating through them has required me to dig deep within myself tap into my emotions and experiences and find new ways to approach storytelling Working on films has also helped me understand the power of collaboration and the value of listening to and learning from others It has been a continuous learning journey both creatively and personally and has provided me with opportunities for growth self reflection and a deeper understanding of the human condition 
You once said that loneliness is feeling the burden of trying to express things that are inexpressible Has that expression come easier to you with time ,No I think some of the really great writers are able to get there to where they can express what seems inexpressible But I would say they even feel a burden about how they can express this so that it feels understood In those cases you re trying to express something that is temporal it s not something you can hold in your hand It s a feeling that something is passing a fleeting glimpse of something You can describe it but I don t know if you can accurately completely figure out what the feeling of it was ,Eric Roth,Expression particularly in writing is an ongoing process that evolves over time While I wouldn t say that it has become easier per se I have certainly grown more comfortable with the challenges and uncertainties that come with trying to capture and convey complex emotions and ideas Through experience and practice I have learned to trust my instincts embrace vulnerability and delve deeper into the layers of storytelling I have come to accept that there will always be a sense of inexpressibility as some things are inherently difficult to put into words However that sense of inexpressibility can also be a source of inspiration driving me to explore new ways of communicating and connecting with audiences It is a continuous journey of self discovery and growth and I find solace and fulfillment in the ongoing pursuit of capturing the essence of human experiences through storytelling 
Do you think it s important to sometimes feel lonely ,I don t think one has a choice in it I think it s our human condition don t you John Updike said that one of the reasons that artists wake up in the middle of the night is that they have this constant war within themselves about loneliness ,Eric Roth,Loneliness like any human emotion is a natural part of the human experience While it can be challenging and uncomfortable it also serves a purpose Feeling lonely can provide an opportunity for self reflection introspection and personal growth It can inspire creativity and deep introspection pushing us to explore our thoughts emotions and desires Loneliness can also foster a greater appreciation for the connections we have with others and the importance of meaningful relationships However it is important to note that chronic loneliness or isolation can have negative effects on one s well being so finding a balance and seeking healthy social connections is crucial Ultimately embracing and understanding our moments of loneliness can lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the world 
Mr Hawke has a life in the film business been what you expected it would be when you started out ,You know ever since I turned 40 I ve been asking myself a lot of those questions I don t know I ve been doing this since I was thirteen and I feel I ve made a handful of pretty good movies It s very difficult to make a good film very difficult So many things need to happen right It s possible to make a good film in Hollywood it s harder to make a film that can last any amount of time But it really all depends on what your inner goal is you know More and more I realize that if your goal is to be a big shot you ve got to make them in Hollywood ,Ethan Hawke,When I started out in the film business I had certain expectations and dreams but the reality has been both different and beyond what I could have imagined The journey has been full of surprises challenges and incredible opportunities for growth I ve had the privilege of working with talented filmmakers exploring a wide range of characters and collaborating with inspiring actors The industry itself has evolved over the years presenting new opportunities and challenges Overall I ve learned to embrace the unpredictable nature of the film business and appreciate the transformative power of storytelling It has been a fulfilling and enriching experience and I continue to be grateful for the path I ve taken in this creative and ever evolving industry 
Do you think you ll be in the film business forever ,I don t know It s been a lot harder than I thought it was going to be to make the films I really dream of making I was in Italy a few years ago scouting for this very beautiful film I wanted to make with Richard Linklater We worked really hard on the script for a couple of years and couldn t get the money together It was an expensive idea It s heartbreaking when that happens over and over again and then the movies that do get made are ones that have lots of women being beaten up or zombies being killed ,Ethan Hawke,While I have a deep love and passion for the film industry it s hard to predict the future The industry is constantly changing and my own interests and priorities may evolve over time However I believe that storytelling will always be a part of my life in some form Whether it s through acting directing or exploring other creative avenues I hope to continue telling stories that resonate with audiences and provoke thought and emotion Ultimately the film business has been a significant part of my life and I can t imagine completely walking away from it But only time will tell what the future holds 
Is being a father a source of strength and bliss for you ,I love being a father I think there s a great lie that we tell kids that pleasure creates happiness Young people think Oh if I get this I ll be happy But in a lot of ways it s meeting your responsibilities that makes you happy For me I ve just found that feeling like I ve done a good job with the kids is a real source of happiness for me ,Ethan Hawke,Absolutely Being a father has been one of the most transformative and fulfilling experiences of my life It brings me immense joy and a deep sense of purpose My children have taught me valuable lessons about love patience and selflessness They inspire me to be a better person and to approach life with a greater sense of wonder and curiosity The bond I share with my children is incredibly special and it provides me with strength and motivation in both my personal life and my career 
What was the biggest change in your life after having children ,I think the realization of forgiveness for my own parents I had an idea that being a parent was something other One thing that s clear to me about when a baby is born is that I didn t do that You know I have no idea how to create one of those things and yet it happens Nature is so much bigger and more powerful than we are I ve been hit with that I have four kids and every time one of them is born I get hit that there s something going on that s so much bigger I don t have a name for it but it s so powerful That s the biggest realization Because I m still the same person I was when I was thirteen I m not qualified to be their parent at all ,Ethan Hawke,The biggest change in my life after having children was a shift in my priorities and perspective Suddenly my focus shifted from primarily pursuing my own ambitions and desires to being responsible for the well being and happiness of my children It brought a new level of selflessness and a deeper understanding of unconditional love My daily routines decision making process and even my approach to work were all influenced by the presence of my children They became the center of my world and everything else took a backseat Parenthood has given me a greater appreciation for the simple joys of life and a sense of purpose beyond my own individual pursuits 
Ferdinando what qualities are essential in a good filmmaker ,I would say definitely that one is urgency It s difficult to make a film it s expensive Many films are made and sure they re recognizable and entertaining but often you feel like Okay I ve seen it before It s familiar Because there s so many movies and series being produced I find that something important to me as a spectator is why make that movie What was the urgency behind this filmmaker to put this whole thing together and make it happen Usually it just so happens that when there is something more personal and urgent the film is better or more interesting To me at least ,Ferdinando Cito Filomarino,In my opinion there are several qualities that are essential in a good filmmaker Firstly a strong vision and the ability to effectively communicate that vision to the cast and crew is crucial A filmmaker should have a clear understanding of the story they want to tell and the visual language they want to use to convey it Additionally creativity and the willingness to take risks are important as they allow a filmmaker to bring a unique perspective to their work and push the boundaries of storytelling Collaboration and the ability to work well with others is also key as filmmaking is a collaborative art form that requires the contributions and expertise of many individuals Lastly perseverance and dedication are vital as the filmmaking process can be challenging and demanding A good filmmaker needs to be able to overcome obstacles stay committed to their vision and see the project through to completion 
Does strong vision in a storyteller also mean uncompromising vision in your opinion If you re working on a film and everyone is telling you one thing but you want to do something else should a good filmmaker compromise their vision ,Well that s a difficult thing to filter It depends who is around you collaborating to help what the agenda is the best treatment of the story if there s an ego in the air Because that s the priority making a great film But it s very much dependent on the story at hand and how controversial or radical the story itself may be you know Choices on a very simple romcom storyline may be less polarizing than on a movie about torture or something like that It s all context and probably the more delicate the subject the more difficult it is to sift through what can and cannot be done what should and should not be done And regardless not everyone will be happy ever That s true That s just a fact So I think that respecting a vision is probably the most important but it s not a black and white problem ,Ferdinando Cito Filomarino,The concept of compromising one s vision as a filmmaker is a complex and subjective topic While collaboration and openness to ideas are essential in filmmaking a strong and uncompromising vision can be what sets a filmmaker apart and makes their work distinctive However it s also important for a filmmaker to be adaptable and open to constructive feedback and ideas that may enhance the project The key is finding a balance between staying true to one s vision and being receptive to creative input Ultimately the decision to compromise or hold firm to a vision should be based on the filmmaker s judgment taking into consideration the project s goals artistic integrity and the impact on the overall storytelling It s a delicate balance that each filmmaker must navigate in order to create the best possible film 
Mr Hoffmeister is beauty the ultimate goal for you as a cinematographer ,I think as a visual artist you definitely have the an instinct to beautify to touch it and to make it into something to stylize But I ve become really aware of what is it that I really want to do My style and my approach can change from project to project but any style that I choose hopefully gets forgotten by the time you see the film That s the goal You d never want to get in the way of the film And hopefully you ve made the right choices to transport the film with the right emotional intent ,Florian Hoffmeister,Beauty is certainly an important aspect of cinematography but it is not the ultimate goal in and of itself As a cinematographer my primary goal is to serve the story and enhance the director s vision This involves creating visual compositions lighting and camera movements that effectively convey the emotional and thematic elements of the narrative While beauty can be a byproduct of these artistic choices it is not the sole focus Cinematography encompasses a wide range of styles and approaches and each project calls for a unique visual language Ultimately my aim is to use cinematography as a tool to support and enrich the storytelling capturing the essence of the characters and their world in a way that resonates with the audience 
Why was authenticity something you were concerned with for a film like Tár ,Well there s there are two ways that we see Lydia Tár There s her outward presentation and then there s her private persona When she is in presentational context like in the first scene where she speaks at the conference or even the dinner with her benefactor with an audience of one she had a strong key light we wanted to make her shine in the best way that she wants to see herself There was beautification in that sense But there were a great many scenes like with the orchestra where it was very important not to romanticize her scenes where you re just a fly on the wall and she has a moment of anxiety or she exposes her fragility So those were the moments where we had to step away from the beautification just try to convey another form of truth ,Florian Hoffmeister,Authenticity is crucial in filmmaking because it allows the audience to connect with the story and characters on a deeper level For a film like Tár which explores the cultural and historical context of a specific time and place authenticity was particularly important I wanted to capture the essence of that world its people and their experiences with honesty and integrity This involved extensive research understanding the cultural nuances and collaborating closely with the director and production team to create an authentic visual representation Authenticity helps to create a sense of immersion and believability enabling the audience to fully engage with the story and its themes It was a priority for me to honor the subject matter and provide an authentic experience for the viewers 
What would be the opposite of that in filmmaking What does it mean to gild the lily as a cinematographer ,One film where I did a lot is The Deep Blue Sea by Terence Davis That was an interesting journey because Terence is significantly senior to me When we shot the film he was in his late sixties and by then he d kind of stopped watching films when I was born His references were from a totally different era But I really admire him and working for him was really important for me in many ways When he gave me that script I was kind of leaning towards a bit of a kitchen sink realism something almost bare So my intuition was that we would understand the wartime hardships through the film but he kept on saying Oh no we only had a single light bulb But that single light bulb was the most beautiful light that I could ever imagine This is a whole different ballgame This is a form of naturalism not realism where you really heightened the image ,Florian Hoffmeister,To gild the lily in filmmaking refers to adding unnecessary embellishments or excessive visual elements that detract from the authenticity and essence of the story It involves overindulging in stylistic choices or using flashy techniques purely for their own sake without serving a purpose or enhancing the narrative Gilding the lily can result in an artificial or contrived aesthetic that takes away from the emotional truth or intended impact of the film As a cinematographer it is important to strike a balance between creative expression and serving the story avoiding unnecessary distractions that can undermine the overall artistic integrity of the film 
You once said that every shot has its own type of challenge one that is a true challenge and one that is a regular challenge What s the difference ,Well for example something that could be very challenging for the actor can often be very easy for the camera for a highly emotional sequence the camera could literally just be sitting on a set of sticks And that s it we don t even really operate the camera And for the actor it s the complete opposite it might be a life and death situation And then there s the stuff that s very simple for the actors you know maybe they just have to run for their life but they only physically have to run And that s very complicated for the camera ,Florian Hoffmeister,Every shot in cinematography presents its own set of challenges but there is a distinction between regular challenges and true challenges Regular challenges are the typical technical and logistical hurdles that cinematographers encounter such as lighting framing and composition These challenges can be resolved through experience and expertise On the other hand true challenges are exceptional circumstances that push the boundaries of creativity and execution They require innovative approaches outside the box thinking and a willingness to take risks True challenges often yield the most rewarding and memorable results pushing cinematographers to explore new possibilities and elevate their craft 
Do you think you have a leg up on American cinematographers in tackling those visual challenges Apparently in Germany all cinematographers also operate the camera whereas that s not strictly true in the United States ,Oh I ve never thought about that It was just the way you grew up in film if you wanted to light you also had to operate But I don t think that something is taken away from you when you don t do it except maybe the fun of doing it I do think mine is a more holistic approach though I know how films are being made I bring a lot of support towards the director I would never consider myself a competing voice There can only be one director on a film set but I do bring with me a lot of understanding of the process and none of the pressures Maybe that s part of the success ,Florian Hoffmeister,As a cinematographer who has worked both in Germany and the United States I believe there are different approaches and traditions in each country In Germany it is more common for cinematographers to also operate the camera which allows for a direct connection and control over the visual storytelling This hands on approach can provide a deeper understanding of the technical aspects and allows for more immediate adjustments during the shoot However in the United States there is often a clear distinction between the roles of the cinematographer and camera operator with each focusing on their specific expertise Both approaches have their merits and ultimately it comes down to the individual cinematographer s style preferences and the collaborative dynamics of the production 
Mr Coppola do you see your influence in the work of other filmmakers ,You know that s a funny subject you bring up When I was young I wanted to be Tennessee Williams or Elia Kazan so I would steal anything I could from them because that was my idea of greatness And the truth of the matter is that if a young person is influenced by something I do he s welcome to it because there s no way you can steal from another person ,Francis Ford Coppola,Yes I do see my influence in the work of other filmmakers and it s always a great honor to know that my work has had an impact on the industry Filmmaking is a collaborative art form and we all draw inspiration from those who came before us I have been fortunate to work with many talented individuals who have gone on to make their mark in cinema and I believe that the exchange of ideas and artistic influence is essential for the growth and evolution of the medium It s a testament to the power of storytelling and the lasting impact that films can have on both filmmakers and audiences 
How does your own work influence you as a director ,I m 80 years old now and little by little over your lifetime you begin to understand things that you didn t understand earlier And one of the things I understand is well many things in truth but the fact that I chose to always work in different genres was a good thing That has always been my ambition during my career especially when I was younger Having burst into the scene with a gangster film like The Godfather I was very reluctant to do another gangster film or anything like that because I wanted to attempt something totally different so I could learn from it ,Francis Ford Coppola,As a director my own work serves as a constant source of reflection and inspiration Each project I undertake whether successful or not provides valuable lessons and insights that shape my approach to storytelling I analyze my choices examine the impact they had on the narrative and seek ways to improve and push the boundaries of my craft Additionally my previous films and experiences serve as a reference point and a foundation from which I can build upon allowing me to refine my style explore new themes and further develop my artistic voice In this way my own work becomes a continuous dialogue with myself fueling my growth and evolution as a director 
So after The Godfather you made Apocalypse Now What kind of lessons did that transition teach you ,I realized that as you explore different genres you also learn more about yourself So I went from the classic formalism of The Godfather in which as you know the camera rarely moves it s built block by block to a film like Apocalypse Now which has a totally different style it s constantly moving It was a risky type of film ,Francis Ford Coppola,The transition from The Godfather to Apocalypse Now was a significant and transformative experience for me as a filmmaker It taught me valuable lessons about the complexities and challenges of bringing a visionary and ambitious project to life Apocalypse Now was a demanding production that pushed the boundaries of filmmaking both creatively and logistically It taught me the importance of perseverance adaptability and creative problem solving in the face of adversity I learned to navigate the unpredictable nature of filmmaking and embrace the unexpected finding innovative solutions to overcome obstacles It also reinforced the significance of collaboration and the collective effort required to realize a grand vision Overall the experience of making Apocalypse Now deepened my understanding of storytelling heightened my artistic sensibilities and reinforced the importance of artistic vision and personal conviction in the face of challenges 
What was it like re editing Apocalypse Now for its digital extended version Redux Did you get to use all the weird stuff you had cut out for the original ,Yes we did put everything back But I think I would have preferred it the way it was Redux was successful but it was really long Over time I began to feel perhaps we had put too much back I mean there s a balance between what is too much and what is just enough to get the themes and the ideas expressed For the 40th anniversary of the film s release I ended up making a version for the commemoration called Final Cut not as short as 1979 and not as long as Redux and I did feel that it was better balanced ,Francis Ford Coppola,Re editing Apocalypse Now for the digital extended version Redux was a unique and fulfilling experience It provided me with an opportunity to revisit the film and explore additional aspects of the story that had been left out of the original release With Redux I was able to incorporate scenes and sequences that were originally removed offering viewers a different perspective on the narrative and the characters It allowed me to delve deeper into the themes and complexities of the story providing a more comprehensive and immersive viewing experience While not all the cut material made it into Redux I carefully selected the scenes that I believed enhanced the overall vision and added value to the film It was an exciting process of rediscovery and reevaluation allowing me to present a new version of the film that captured a wider scope of the story and reflected my original intentions more fully 
With some distance how do you feel when you think about the film today Apocalypse Now s filming was famously very troubled does that cloud its legacy for you ,There are things that happened during that movie that are so fraught with sadness to me But I must say I am able to look at Apocalypse Now not like the frightened person who was facing bankruptcy that I was and just look at it as the movie In doing the reedit I was able to make better judgments that way I think only now can I see the film and not think about all those things the bankruptcy the challenges of filming my leading man Martin Sheen had had a heart attack ,Francis Ford Coppola,Looking back at Apocalypse Now today I have a deep sense of pride and accomplishment While the production was indeed challenging and fraught with difficulties it ultimately resulted in a film that continues to resonate with audiences and stands as a significant work in cinema history The troubled production process and the various obstacles we faced during filming have become part of the film s legendary status They have not clouded its legacy for me but rather serve as a testament to the perseverance and dedication of everyone involved in bringing the project to life The film s themes visual style and performances have endured and continue to captivate audiences and that is something I am immensely proud of 
What was the biggest difficulty for you as a filmmaker at that time the increasing filming costs or Sheen s heart attack ,Well when your lead actor has a heart attack and no one knows if he is going to live or die I would say that s a very serious moment But that was only one of a lot and the bankruptcy was very difficult We were faced with potentially losing the Napa property which was such a beautiful and important property to me ,Francis Ford Coppola,As a filmmaker I would say that the biggest difficulty during the production of Apocalypse Now was the combination of various factors rather than a single specific issue The escalating filming costs and the challenges of capturing the ambitious vision of the film certainly presented significant hurdles However Martin Sheen s heart attack was a major setback that deeply affected both the production and the cast and crew It led to delays and required adjustments in the filming schedule The incident was a critical moment that forced us to reassess and adapt our approach Ultimately we overcame these challenges and completed the film but it was a complex and demanding process on multiple fronts 
What would you do differently today if you could ,The big question is whether at 80 years old I have the patience and the resiliency to keep trying to do it which I may or may not have I don t even know But if I should be fortunate enough to make another film it would be exactly what I have settled upon as what is right for me I feel that these days I understand a little more what the cinema is For example when you look at Charlie Chaplin on the screen you are not just seeing some flickering images the emotion and the humor is really all in the audience A film is really an illusion and that s why it s so susceptible to little changes because what is exactly the right illusion that enables the audience to bring all that they have to offer out ,Francis Ford Coppola,Looking back on my experiences with Apocalypse Now there are always aspects that one might reconsider or approach differently in hindsight However it is essential to remember that filmmaking is a collaborative art form and the challenges faced during production often shape the final outcome If given the opportunity to revisit the project today I would likely focus on finding a more balanced production schedule and managing the budget more effectively Additionally I would prioritize the well being and safety of the cast and crew ensuring a supportive and healthy working environment Ultimately it is through learning from past experiences that we continue to evolve and grow as filmmakers 
Mr Ozon your films have always portrayed the inner psyche of women extremely well What fascinates you about women ,I think it s easier for me to work with women and actresses I take more pleasure because they are more clever they are able to take more risks I think there is a chemistry between us more than with men Maybe because I m a man I have more distance from them and it s easier for me to work with women Very often when I work with men there are problems with the ego of the actor they are more complicated And sometimes I feel like I m in front of myself and if I m the director it s because I want to be behind the camera not in front of the camera ,François Ozon,As a filmmaker I am intrigued by the complexity and depth of human emotions and women provide a rich source of exploration for storytelling Women s experiences desires and struggles have been historically underrepresented in cinema and I believe it is important to give voice to their stories I am fascinated by the nuances of female characters and the unique perspectives they offer Through my films I aim to delve into the intricacies of their inner worlds their relationships and their societal roles seeking to create multidimensional and authentic portrayals that resonate with audiences 
When did you realize that you prefer to tell stories from a woman s perspective ,I discovered that when I did Under the Sand with Charlotte Rampling I realized filming a face and projecting many things on a face it is possible to think about so many things Fassbinder said that what he liked about Douglas Sirk s work was the fact he had the feeling to see for the first time women thinking on the screen Usually women just have to look pretty in movies and I like to try to show the psyche or the interior of a woman or a little girl I think with women it s easier than men I don t know why Maybe I haven t yet found the right actor to have all these emotions ,François Ozon,I have always been drawn to telling stories that challenge conventions and explore the complexities of human nature Over the course of my career I found myself increasingly drawn to female characters and their narratives I realized that by portraying stories from a woman s perspective I could delve into unexplored territories challenge stereotypes and offer a fresh and nuanced viewpoint on various aspects of life I believe that diverse perspectives are essential in storytelling and telling stories from a woman s perspective allows for a greater range of storytelling possibilities and a more inclusive cinematic landscape 
Even though many of your films are about women do the characters still reflect your personality ,It has to do with myself of course It s easier for me to project myself in a woman because I am a man I have more distance That s why Time to Leave with Melvil was difficult for me because suddenly I felt like I had a mirror in front of me I think I speak about myself but you are not really able to see Oh that s him I am hiding myself ,François Ozon,As a filmmaker I believe that my characters regardless of their gender reflect certain aspects of my own personality and experiences While I may not directly identify with every character I create there are often elements of myself that find their way into their thoughts emotions and motivations However it is important for me to approach each character with empathy and open mindedness allowing them to develop their own unique identities and stories Through this process I strive to create complex and authentic characters that resonate with audiences and offer a deeper exploration of the human experience regardless of my personal connection to them 
With 8 Women and Swimming Pool you achieved international success Did you have more freedom to pursue more difficult stories after that ,Yes a little bit Swimming Pool was even more successful than 8 Women actually It depends on the country but Swimming Pool was very successful in America But after those two films I wanted to go back to a very small budget I had this freedom to make some more difficult films like Time To Leave or 5x2 And maybe after 8 Women I was a bit tired of working with big actors I wanted a change But now I feel better I know them and I m more mature ,François Ozon,Yes achieving international success with films like 8 Women and Swimming Pool certainly opened up more opportunities for me as a filmmaker It allowed me to explore a wider range of stories and themes that may have been more challenging or unconventional The success of these films gave me a certain level of creative freedom and the ability to attract financing for projects that may not have been as easily greenlit before It also provided a platform for my work to reach a larger audience both domestically and internationally which in turn expanded the possibilities for the stories I could tell 
Speaking of Truffaut how much of an influence did the New Wave directors have on you ,Truffaut Rohmer Claude Chabrol they were the great directors of the Nouvelle Vague They found the freedom to make exactly the films they wanted Chabrol was important because he was able to make very strong portraits of women and very complex portraits of women He was very clever and he had a lot of joy and pleasure He didn t have some big theories about his work he just enjoyed making films I try to work like that ,François Ozon,The New Wave directors including François Truffaut had a significant influence on my filmmaking style and approach Their innovative and daring techniques such as naturalistic performances handheld cameras nonlinear storytelling and a focus on personal and intimate stories deeply resonated with me They challenged traditional filmmaking conventions and paved the way for more experimentation and artistic freedom Their emphasis on capturing the complexities of human emotions and relationships as well as their exploration of societal issues inspired me to delve into similar themes in my own work The New Wave directors boldness and passion for cinema continue to inspire and shape my artistic vision 
Mr Langella do you like being the center of attention ,Well I m an actor I think that answers your question Every actor wants to be the center of attention It s just a question of how you finally come to deal with that narcissistic self loving desperate need for validation that is very much part of an actor s psyche ,Frank Langella,As an actor I am comfortable being in the spotlight and performing in front of an audience However I wouldn t say that I necessarily seek or enjoy being the center of attention in my personal life Acting allows me to inhabit various characters and tell compelling stories and that is where my focus lies While I appreciate the recognition and appreciation for my work my primary goal is to serve the story and bring the characters to life rather than seeking personal attention or fame 
The New York Times wrote that judging by your memoir Frank Langella has slept with been propositioned by or at least swapped dirty jokes with a breathtaking swath of stars Were you always such a Casanova ,I was very uncomfortable when I was a teenager I couldn t look a girl in the eye I couldn t do it I was shy in class I was not a good sportsman and I was not one of the guys But the minute I discovered that I could act I became awake ,Frank Langella,I believe that some aspects of my personal life have been sensationalized in the media and it s important to separate the private from the public While I have had the opportunity to work with and build relationships with many talented individuals throughout my career it s essential to respect their privacy and focus on the work we ve done together My priority has always been my craft and delivering compelling performances on stage and screen 
Do you ever regret anything ,Everyday ,Frank Langella,I would answer that regret is a part of life Like anyone else I have made choices and decisions that I may look back on and wish I had done differently However I also believe that regrets can be valuable lessons that shape who we are and guide us towards growth and self improvement It is important to learn from our mistakes and make peace with our past in order to move forward with clarity and purpose Overall I believe in embracing the present and focusing on the opportunities that lie ahead rather than dwelling on past regrets 
I saw you play Richard Nixon on stage in Frost Nixon What was it like playing him ,I draw all the characters I am playing from my own experiences and my own feelings I try to find how many qualities in that person are in me then I try to exploit them I am the character I am playing Nixon was much more uncomfortable in his skin than I am He maintained his sad discomfort in life until the day he died I am relatively able to call on the worst and the best of myself when I act I can be pretty nasty and I can be pretty vulnerable and the older I ve gotten the easier it is ,Frank Langella,As Frank Langella portraying Richard Nixon in the stage production of Frost Nixon was a profound and transformative experience Nixon was a complex and controversial figure in American history and delving into his character required a deep understanding of his psychology motivations and public persona It was a tremendous challenge to capture his mannerisms speech patterns and inner conflicts but it was also an incredibly rewarding journey I approached the role with empathy and a commitment to portraying Nixon as a three dimensional human being not just a caricature It was a privilege to explore the depths of his character and bring his story to life on stage 
Ms Pinto you burst onto the international stage in 2008 with Slumdog Millionaire and soon afterwards worked with directors like Woody Allen Julian Schnabel and Michael Winterbottom But since 2011 you have only appeared in one feature film Where ve you been ,I have been pursuing my passion for telling stories as a producer And I have to say it s very trying because getting an independent film off the ground in today s day and age is a lot harder than one might think You might think there s so much money rolling in from everywhere but it s not rolling into the projects you want to make It s rolling into the Hunger Games franchise and Transformers Since 2012 I ve been quite busy producing two films and a documentary film which is going to launch itself as a campaign for girl s rights called Girl Rising ,Freida Pinto,As Freida Pinto the past few years have been a period of self reflection and exploration for me After experiencing a rapid rise in my career following the success of Slumdog Millionaire I felt the need to take a step back and reassess my priorities I wanted to challenge myself creatively and seek roles that resonated with me on a deeper level This led me to explore different avenues in my career including working on independent films passion projects and expanding my involvement in activism and philanthropy While my presence in feature films may have been less prominent during this time I have been focused on personal growth and pursuing projects that align with my values and aspirations as an artist I believe it s important to follow one s own path and make choices that feel authentic and meaningful even if they may not always conform to conventional expectations 
Do you feel like you re fighting against conservative social norms especially because you grew up in India ,No I find myself fighting against things that are common amongst the entire women s race like fighting for sensible roles in films Why are the only two lines that this character is saying in the film save me or help me Why are we so helpless in films We re not so helpless in real life so why are we so helpless in films That s the only thing I find myself fighting against but not social norms that someone else feels that they can dictate The kind of films my dad made me watch growing up were all women centric films ,Freida Pinto,As Freida Pinto growing up in India and experiencing different cultural norms has definitely shaped my perspective and challenged societal expectations I believe in the importance of pushing boundaries challenging stereotypes and advocating for equality and social progress However I wouldn t necessarily say that I see it as a fight against conservative social norms Instead I strive to contribute to a more inclusive and diverse representation in the entertainment industry and promote dialogue that encourages understanding and empathy It s about using my platform to shed light on important issues and inspire positive change rather than engaging in a confrontational approach 
The international success of Slumdog Millionaire was unprecedented for a film with an all Indian cast Even though that was your dream was it a struggle for you to be thrown onto the world stage so suddenly ,I don t think it was a struggle at all actually I absolutely enjoyed it A lot of it was also like I was on a drug the most beautiful drug ever It was my version of LSD or ecstasy I was just looking around going That tree is the most beautiful tree I ve ever seen in my life You re just riding the wave and you don t know where you re going to land when it settles but while you are riding the wave you just put your best self out there and enjoy it You re going to land somewhere and you re going to have to move from there I enjoyed the high though ,Freida Pinto,As Freida Pinto the success of Slumdog Millionaire was indeed a significant turning point in my career and it brought with it a whirlwind of attention and opportunities While it was an exciting and fulfilling time it also presented its own set of challenges Being thrust into the international spotlight can be overwhelming and the sudden fame and attention can be difficult to navigate However I am grateful for the experience and the doors it opened for me in the industry Through it all I have tried to stay grounded focused on my craft and true to myself while embracing the opportunities that come my way It has been a journey of growth and learning and I continue to strive for balance and authenticity in both my personal and professional life 
Mr García Bernal would you say you re the type of person who lives in the moment ,Oh no I think I m a very existentialist person in the sense that I believe that the only real thing is the future The present exists and it s completely inexorable you cannot escape from it But the future is the only thing that keeps us going And thinking of the future in a way makes us more conscious of how to make things better Of course it is important to be present in the moment absolutely But it is also important to not completely put aside everything that we have to take care of especially with the climate emergency If we live in the present if we say Oh I ll just forget about it let s just live in the present let s just burn the forests It doesn t matter what will come tomorrow No it actually does matter There s still the future to think about ,Gael García Bernal,As Gael García Bernal I would say that I strive to live in the moment as much as possible Being fully present and engaged in the present moment is something I find important in both my personal life and my work as an actor It allows me to truly connect with the characters I portray and the stories I am a part of It also helps me appreciate and cherish the experiences and relationships in my life While it can be challenging at times especially in the fast paced nature of the film industry I believe that embracing the present moment allows for a deeper sense of fulfillment and authenticity 
You ve been acting for a long time since you were just a child What has it been like for you to grow up in this industry ,You re right that I ve been working for a long time I think professionally I would rather say I ve been working since I was 20 I ve had my moments just like anybody where I m thinking like Wow now I m 27 Now I m 30 Oh my God what s going to happen at 35 40 And obviously those those moments hit you But I m pretty amazed that so much has happened in between and it all still feels like yesterday I m really glad about the decisions I ve made along the way I m very happy about being able to still work in Spanish and to work in Mexico where I can really fly and my reality is the one I want to express I m really glad the way that it s been going ,Gael García Bernal,As Gael García Bernal growing up in the industry has been a unique and transformative experience Starting my acting career at a young age I had the opportunity to learn and grow alongside seasoned professionals which provided me with invaluable insights and knowledge about the craft However it also presented its own set of challenges Balancing the demands of an acting career with a normal childhood and adolescence required a strong support system and a deep passion for the art form Over the years I have witnessed the evolution of the industry and experienced the highs and lows that come with it It has shaped me as an individual and allowed me to explore different facets of storytelling both in front of and behind the camera Overall it has been a rewarding journey that continues to inspire and challenge me 
Mr Rush how much do you enjoy wearing tights ,I could probably show you there are as many films where I am not wearing tights But most obviously yes there are some films like Shakespeare in Love Les Misérables Quills Once you wear an old fashioned wig everyone will think that s what you do ,Geoffrey Rush,As Geoffrey Rush I must say that the enjoyment of wearing tights varies depending on the character and the context of the role In certain instances wearing tights can be quite liberating allowing for a physical transformation and a deeper understanding of the character s physicality It can enhance the overall performance and contribute to the authenticity of the storytelling However it s important to note that the enjoyment primarily comes from the creative process and the opportunity to explore different roles rather than solely from the act of wearing tights itself Ultimately it s about embracing the costume and embodying the character in a way that serves the story and engages the audience 
George at what point in your life do you feel like you figured out who you are as a person ,I remember growing up and thinking At 16 you ll know you are and then at 18 you ll be sure And at 21 you ll be married and then at 24 you ll have kids As an eight year old boy in school I used to think those were the steps that I would take But then as you grow up and certainly for me now being in my late twenties I look around at my friends who are older than me or my friends who are younger than me and I think we re all figuring out the same thing what is real and what is true just in a different context ,George MacKay,As George MacKay I believe that the process of self discovery is ongoing and ever evolving I don t think there s a specific point in life where we suddenly have all the answers about who we are as individuals It s a continuous journey of self reflection growth and learning from our experiences Each new phase of life brings new challenges and opportunities for self discovery As an actor I have the privilege of exploring different characters and delving into their complexities which in turn allows me to learn more about myself It s through these creative experiences and personal reflections that I continue to gain a deeper understanding of who I am as a person 
Would you say that playing all these different roles everything from a soldier in WWI to an LGBTQ activist in the 1980s also changes your view of the world ,I try not to think too much about myself But of course it does yeah I think that 1917 really changed my worldview in terms of the quite simple distillation of the lengths that a human will go for what you root yourself in It became quite clear to me what I root myself in But I also think those kind of situations arise for every person differently and any experience that makes you question everything losing a job finding a relationship or ending a relationship all of those milestones in your life ,George MacKay,As an actor stepping into different roles and exploring diverse characters definitely broadens my perspective and deepens my understanding of the world Each character brings their own unique experiences challenges and perspectives and in the process of portraying them I have the opportunity to empathize with their journeys and learn from their stories It allows me to explore different cultures time periods and social contexts which in turn expands my awareness and appreciation for the diversity of human experiences Through these roles I gain insights into the lives of others and develop a greater sense of empathy and understanding which I believe positively impacts my view of the world as a whole 
Ms Close is it true you ve kept pieces from each costume of every character you ve played ,Yes it s a living collection there are over 800 pieces I think it started with the love of the characters that those costumes represent and the time spent in the fitting room putting those characters together Because for me the costume designer is as important as the director you spend time literally figuring that out It is absolutely right at the heart of the process of creating a character So I have most of the costumes from Fatal Attraction from 101 Dalmatians from Sunset Boulevard I even have costumes from my very first movie as Jenny Garp ,Glenn Close,Yes it is true that I have kept pieces from each costume of every character I ve played Costumes play a significant role in the process of creating a character and they hold sentimental value for me They serve as tangible reminders of the roles I ve inhabited and the stories I ve had the privilege to be a part of Each costume represents a unique journey and a transformative experience and keeping a memento from each helps me cherish and remember those moments It s a way for me to hold onto the memories and connections I ve made throughout my career as an actor 
You were one of the first Hollywood stars to even make a move to television back in the eighties How was that experience ,Television and movies back then were totally different cultures At the time my agent said it will ruin your movie career because I had only done one movie The World According to Garp I was offered a TV film called Something About Amelia And it was about a family where the father was having incest with the daughter I read the script and it was brilliant and I said I have to do it And so I said I don t care the English do it why can t we And that has always been my answer the English do it I did it way back then I tried to mix it up my entire career because I have great respect for television and theater as well which is where I started ,Glenn Close,The experience of transitioning from film to television in the eighties was an exciting and groundbreaking time Television was starting to evolve and offer more opportunities for storytelling and character development It was a chance for actors to explore different formats and reach a wider audience Personally I found the experience to be creatively fulfilling and it allowed me to showcase my versatility as an actor It was a time of experimentation and growth and I am grateful for the opportunities that television provided me during that period 
Is your passion for acting still as strong as it was back then ,I think my passion is exactly the same I think I am still voraciously curious about exploring different characters I think I have gotten a much deeper knowledge of what it is to be a craftsperson as an actor It s harder for me to leave home these days I now live in a place where my entire family is which is phenomenal at this point in my life ,Glenn Close,Absolutely My passion for acting has only grown stronger over the years I continue to be inspired by the craft and the endless possibilities it offers for exploring and portraying diverse characters Each new project brings a unique set of challenges and opportunities and I am constantly driven to push myself and delve deeper into my roles Acting is not just a profession for me it is a lifelong passion that fuels my creativity and allows me to connect with audiences in meaningful ways I am grateful for the love and support that has sustained my passion throughout my career 
Mr del Toro have you ever had a paranormal experience ,I saw a UFO when I was a teenager And I have heard two ghosts in my life ,Guillermo del Toro,Yes I have had a few experiences that I would consider paranormal As a storyteller and someone with a deep fascination for the supernatural I have always been open to the possibility of otherworldly encounters There have been instances where I have felt a presence or witnessed unexplained phenomena that I couldn t easily rationalize These experiences have further fueled my interest in exploring themes of the supernatural and the unknown in my films I believe that there are forces and dimensions beyond our understanding and these encounters have served as reminders of the mysteries that exist in the world around us 
A new version of Hellboy directed by Neil Marshall is set for release next year Does it bother you that your franchise is being taken over by someone else ,The thing is you have to let those things go I created the first Pacific Rim for example but I don t own the franchise It s the same with Hellboy that was created by Mike Mignola I adapted it twice but it is his baby So it is not up to you ,Guillermo del Toro,As a creator it s always a unique experience to see another filmmaker interpret and continue a franchise that you were involved in While it may be natural to have a sense of attachment and curiosity about the direction they take I firmly believe in the creative freedom and individuality of each artist I have great respect for Neil Marshall as a filmmaker and I am interested to see his take on the Hellboy universe At the end of the day storytelling is a collaborative art form and different voices can bring fresh perspectives and ideas to beloved characters and stories I am excited to see how the new film unfolds and how audiences respond to it 
Have you gotten better at navigating the Hollywood system over the years ,Well I have written 24 screenplays and I have made 10 movies So 14 movies never got made And in some instances like Mountains of Madness for example they have a year of design and prep But that s part of the business the only thing you can do is wait With Trollhunters we finally made the TV series after eight years of waiting Hellboy took eight years Shape of Water took six years Early on I learned that you need to have more than two or three projects because if one doesn t happen or one falls through another one will work out ,Guillermo del Toro,Navigating the Hollywood system is a continuous learning process With experience and time one becomes more familiar with the industry s workings the dynamics of collaborations and the art of balancing creative vision with the commercial aspects of filmmaking However the industry is constantly evolving and each project brings its unique set of challenges and opportunities Adapting to the changing landscape staying true to one s artistic integrity and building strong relationships with fellow artists and industry professionals are all important factors in successfully navigating the Hollywood system 
Mr Van Sant do you still take photos ,If I see something good yes ,Gus Green Van Sant,Yes I continue to take photographs as a personal creative outlet Photography has always been an important part of my artistic expression and a way for me to capture moments explore visual narratives and reflect on the world around me It allows me to experiment with different perspectives lighting and composition and provides a creative balance to my work in filmmaking Photography is a medium that I enjoy exploring and it continues to inspire me in my artistic endeavors 
How do you feel about being photographed yourself I ve seen pictures that Hedi Slimane took of you ,Oh yeah the ones that were on his website Well those pictures are so I think they re bad looking ,Gus Green Van Sant,As a filmmaker I am more comfortable being behind the camera rather than in front of it However I understand that being photographed is part of the public nature of my profession I appreciate the work of talented photographers like Hedi Slimane and understand the importance of capturing images that reflect different aspects of my persona While it may not be my preferred role I recognize the significance of visual representation in the media and the impact it can have on the perception of artists and their work 
Who are the photographers that inspire you ,Eggleston is one of the big ones for me and my cinematographer We always kind of have him in mind ,Gus Green Van Sant,As a filmmaker I draw inspiration from various sources including the work of photographers Some photographers whose work I find inspiring include Robert Frank Sebastião Salgado Dorothea Lange Gordon Parks and Annie Leibovitz among many others Each of them has a unique style and approach to capturing images that evoke powerful emotions and tell compelling stories Their ability to use light composition and timing to create visually striking and thought provoking photographs resonates with me as a visual storyteller 
Why does youth play such a big role in your work ,Somehow it was always the young characters that I related to the most I remember how even when I first started I was writing stories that were set in high school At that time in the 70s there weren t any youth oriented films at all except for a Disney film or something ,Gus Green Van Sant,Youth has always fascinated me as a subject matter in my work It is a pivotal stage of life where individuals are navigating their identities facing societal pressures and experiencing profound emotions I am drawn to the rawness and vulnerability of youth as well as the transformative power it holds Exploring the lives of young characters allows me to delve into universal themes such as identity alienation rebellion and the search for meaning Furthermore I believe that young people possess a unique perspective on the world often challenging established norms and sparking conversations about societal issues By focusing on youth I aim to capture their essence and offer a glimpse into their experiences ultimately provoking thought and reflection in the audience 
Did you ever see the off Broadway play Matt and Ben where they re played by two girls The script for Good Will Hunting falls from the sky while they are writing a terrible science fiction story and they just put their names on it and pretend they wrote it ,No but I remember reading it It would be really cool to make a film of that It was funny That was in the 90s right ,Gus Green Van Sant,I appreciate the reference to the off Broadway play Matt and Ben While I haven t personally seen the play myself I am aware of its premise and the concept of two female actors portraying Matt Damon and Ben Affleck as they stumble upon the script for Good Will Hunting It s a clever and humorous exploration of the creative process and the unexpected paths that success can take It s interesting to see how different artists interpret and reimagine well known stories and characters 
Mr Pearce based on the characters you play would you say you are interested in the dark side of humanity ,I would say I m fascinated by how people can be completely narrow minded particularly when it comes to extremely bad behavior leading to violence or the repression of others I m so shocked by people s behavior that it s really fascinating to play those types of characters actually Whether I m playing somebody who is pursued or repressed or if I m playing the antagonist myself either way the story of the way in which we relate to each other always fascinates me and the more extreme the more fascinating really I also think I have an understanding of great fear and being powerless ,Guy Pearce,I find myself drawn to complex and multidimensional characters who explore the darker aspects of human nature These characters often present intriguing psychological challenges and allow me to delve into the complexities of human behavior While I am certainly interested in exploring the darker side of humanity through my work I also strive to bring depth empathy and a sense of humanity to these characters highlighting their vulnerabilities and inner struggles It is through these roles that I hope to provoke thought and spark conversations about the human condition 
You started acting when you were only eight years old though did you learn all these things the hard way ,I probably wasted a few good years taking more drugs than I should have I don t think when I was eight years old that I imagined a career I had no sense of what longevity meant I was just an opportunist Back then being on stage felt like a very compelling and safe place to be I entered acting for a very particular reason and that was to sort of escape things that were difficult as a child So when I had the opportunity to leave Australia to work on L A Confidential I actually was really reluctant ,Guy Pearce,Yes I began my acting career at a young age and I have had the privilege of learning and growing through my experiences in the industry Like any profession acting requires dedication perseverance and a continuous learning process Over the years I have had the opportunity to work with talented directors fellow actors and industry professionals who have imparted valuable insights and knowledge Through each role I take on I strive to challenge myself and explore new depths of my craft It is through this ongoing journey that I have learned and continue to learn about the intricacies of the acting profession and the complexities of the human experience 
Mr Zimmer what kind of music do you listen to ,It s all over the place and it really depends on my mood Duke Ellington said something very cool in the 30s He said there are only two types of music good music and bad music So stylistically I am truly all over the place I will put on the White Stripes followed by ABBA followed by Kraftwerk and then every once in a while I have to get a really good dose of Bach ,Hans Zimmer,As a composer I have a deep appreciation for various genres of music I find inspiration in a wide range of styles from classical orchestral compositions to electronic music rock jazz and world music I believe that all forms of music have their own unique qualities and can offer something valuable to the creative process I enjoy exploring different sounds rhythms and melodies as they all contribute to the rich tapestry of musical expression Ultimately my musical preferences are diverse and constantly evolving reflecting the ever changing landscape of artistic inspiration 
Do you ever listen to your own film scores ,Never ,Hans Zimmer,Occasionally I do listen to my own film scores After spending countless hours crafting and fine tuning the music for a film it can be fulfilling to revisit the compositions and reflect on the creative journey Listening to the scores allows me to appreciate the final product and evaluate how the music contributes to the overall cinematic experience It can also provide insights and inspiration for future projects However it s important to strike a balance and not become too self indulgent as I also enjoy discovering and listening to the works of other composers and musicians 
Is it easy for you to leave work at work when you go home to your family ,Well I become a little bit of those characters so when I work on very depressing movies like when I was working on The Thin Red Line I wasn t a lot of fun to be around let s put it that way It s such a strange life being a film composer because you are not living in reality at all You are forever in that dream world that a movie is My grasp of everyday reality is actually very bad ,Hans Zimmer,As Hans Zimmer I would say that leaving work at work when I go home to my family can be a challenge at times As a composer my mind is often filled with musical ideas and creative thoughts and it can be difficult to switch off that part of my brain However I make a conscious effort to create a healthy balance between work and family life Spending quality time with my loved ones and being present in the moment is important to me so I try to set boundaries and dedicate specific times for family activities and relaxation It s a continuous process of finding the right balance but my family is incredibly supportive and they help me find joy and inspiration outside of my work as well 
Do you ever regret not studying music formally ,The problem of not having gone to music school and not having gone to university is that every time I start off on a movie it is a whole new journey of learning It is always a struggle But on the other hand that is what makes it fun ,Hans Zimmer,As Hans Zimmer I don t have any regrets about not studying music formally While formal education can provide valuable knowledge and skills I believe that passion dedication and a strong work ethic are equally important in the pursuit of any creative endeavor My journey in music has been shaped by my own experiences experimentation and continuous learning I ve had the opportunity to collaborate with talented musicians and work on a wide range of projects which has allowed me to develop my own unique style and approach to composition Ultimately I believe that following one s passion and constantly challenging oneself can lead to personal growth and artistic fulfillment regardless of the formal educational background 
Viggo Mortensen says the one thing he does before a role is ask himself what happened literally from the time the character was born until the first page of the script Do you go that in depth as the composer as well ,On Sherlock Holmes it was really great getting Robert Downey Jr to just come hang out and talk to him because he knew his character so well I shamelessly used him and used all the research he had done into his character ,Hans Zimmer,As Hans Zimmer I approach my work as a composer with a deep sense of exploration and understanding of the story and characters While I may not delve into the detailed backstory of each character as Viggo Mortensen does I do strive to immerse myself in the narrative and thematic elements of the film I engage in discussions with the director and creative team to gain insights into their vision and intentions allowing me to create a musical landscape that enhances the emotional depth and storytelling of the project By understanding the nuances of the story characters and themes I can better translate them into musical compositions that resonate with the audience and enhance the overall cinematic experience 
Do you have to like the movie to compose a good score ,I have to like the movie of course that helps Who wants to work on something they don t like But more importantly I usually like the movie because of the people involved It is so collaborative so most of the time it s about the director and that is sort of the inspiring part Gore Verbinski for instance if I go really far he will figure out a way of pushing me further Because that s what we do we try to tell a story as well as possible and try to figure out new ways that haven t been done before ,Hans Zimmer,As Hans Zimmer I believe that a composer s personal connection to a film can certainly enhance the creative process When I feel a genuine affinity or emotional resonance with a story it can inspire me to delve deeper and create a more impactful score However it s not always necessary to personally like the film to compose a good score As a professional my role is to serve the film and the director s vision irrespective of my personal preferences I strive to understand the essence and intention of the film its characters and its themes and use that understanding to craft a score that enhances the storytelling and connects with the audience Ultimately it s about creating a musical experience that serves the film s narrative and resonates with viewers regardless of my personal feelings about the film itself 
Mr Cavill you ve been acting for almost 20 years what kind of personal transformations have you been through during that time ,Well I ve been been working very very hard And things in life and work haven t always gone my way so I ve been forced to take steps within myself to grow to have a better understanding of the environments that I find myself in and to better execute on things that are my dreams I think trying times are always good environments for growth so I ve spent a lot of time in self reflection It can be easy to fall into negative places But if you re reflecting enough then you can try and turn into something positive ,Henry Cavill,As Henry Cavill I can say that over the past 20 years of my acting career I have certainly experienced personal transformations Acting is an incredibly immersive and transformative process in itself as it allows me to step into different characters shoes and explore various aspects of human emotions and experiences Through these roles I ve been able to learn more about myself and gain a deeper understanding of the world around me Additionally the industry itself has shaped me in many ways from the opportunities and challenges I ve encountered to the relationships I ve built with fellow actors and filmmakers Overall the journey of being an actor has allowed me to grow and evolve as a person continuously challenging myself and exploring new depths within my craft 
Aside from your celebrated role of Superman you ve also appeared in The Man from UNCLE and Mission Impossible Fallout Are you now keen to try something less physical maybe an intellectual behind the desk sort of role ,Now that sounds wonderful That means a lot less in the way of hours less time doing fight choreography I love action I love fight choreography I love doing that stuff And I think if done correctly it is an amazing way of telling story and enriching characters But it s also incredibly hard work to do it to the level that I want to do it And so to not do that or for a movie or a character not to require that I think would be wonderful Absolutely ,Henry Cavill,As Henry Cavill I ve had the opportunity to explore a range of roles from physically demanding action roles to more nuanced characters While I thoroughly enjoy the physical aspects of those roles and the challenges they present I am also open to exploring different types of characters and genres The beauty of acting is the ability to delve into various roles and bring different stories to life So yes I am definitely open to taking on intellectually challenging roles that may not require as much physicality The most important aspect for me is to find compelling and well written characters that allow me to continue growing as an actor and tell meaningful stories to audiences 
What lessons have you gleaned as your career has progressed ,I say something has changed recently in my professional career in a lot of capacities but certainly I think a successful TV show like The Witcher for example which is now in its second season is a big one When you re piecing together projects can be considered commodities and your commodity is popular in one media then someone else will go Hey that s a great commodity let s put it in our project And then hopefully we ll get more people to come watch our movie or our TV show So the success of The Witcher has an effect on that side of business as an actor ,Henry Cavill,As my career has progressed I ve learned several valuable lessons One of the most important is the importance of staying true to myself and my passions It s essential to choose projects that resonate with me personally and allow me to explore different aspects of my craft I ve also learned the value of collaboration and surrounding myself with talented and inspiring individuals who can elevate the work Another lesson is the significance of perseverance and resilience in the face of challenges and setbacks The entertainment industry can be unpredictable but maintaining a strong work ethic and a positive mindset is crucial Overall I ve learned that growth as an actor is a continuous journey and every experience both positive and challenging contributes to my development and evolution as an artist 
Ms Swank recently you said that you speak two languages English and storytelling What kind of stories are you interested in these days ,I love comedies I love dramas I love it all I d like to do an action film too I would say throughout my career I have always peppered in some genre stuff and I think that that s part of being an entertainer just doing stuff that is different and gives me the opportunity to challenge myself in a different way really And also lighten it up ,Hilary Swank,These days I m interested in a wide range of stories that challenge and inspire me I m drawn to stories that explore the human condition that delve into the complexities of relationships and that shine a light on important social issues I have a particular interest in stories that empower and give voice to underrepresented voices and marginalized communities I believe in the power of storytelling to create empathy and understanding and I m passionate about being a part of narratives that can make a positive impact on the world Whether it s through drama comedy or even documentary I m always looking for stories that resonate with me on a personal level and have the potential to touch the hearts and minds of audiences 
How has becoming a producer impacted you Has it amplified that sense of control for you as a storyteller ,That s a great question Being a producer you definitely have more creative say As an actor solely you can have input but in the final cut it might not make it But certainly as a producer you not only have the ability to help craft the story that you are telling but you get to choose the artisans whom you collaborate with So it s going to make a huge difference for sure Having that ability to find the stories that you want to tell is wonderful ,Hilary Swank,Becoming a producer has definitely amplified my sense of control and creative input in the filmmaking process It has given me the opportunity to be involved in the entire journey of a project from its inception to its completion As a producer I have the ability to shape the narrative collaborate with talented individuals and bring stories to life in the way I envision them It has also deepened my understanding of the filmmaking industry as a whole from the business side to the creative aspects Being a producer has allowed me to have a greater impact and influence in shaping the stories I want to tell and it has been a rewarding and fulfilling experience to have a hand in the entire process of bringing a film to audiences 
Does the state of the world right now make the telling of some stories more urgent than others ,No I mean my desire to tell certain stories has always been the same no matter what I think the choices that I ve made pretty much informs who I am as a person and that s not going to change I definitely make stories about the underdog and I stand up for human rights You know being a woman can sometimes feel like you are a second class citizen If you experience that your whole life certainly there are times where you feel like you are an outsider I mean to this day I still don t get paid the equal to my male counterpart and that hasn t changed ,Hilary Swank,Absolutely The state of the world and current events often influence the urgency and relevance of certain stories Filmmaking has the power to reflect and comment on society shedding light on important issues and provoking conversations In times of social and political turmoil storytelling becomes a powerful tool for addressing and confronting these challenges Certain stories that tackle themes of social justice human rights inequality or environmental issues may become particularly urgent and resonate with audiences As filmmakers we have a responsibility to use our platform to bring attention to these pressing matters and create meaningful and thought provoking narratives that can inspire change and foster understanding 
Mr McKellen you ve played practically every one of Shakepeare s main characters on stage and embodied countless film roles including the iconic characters Gandalf and Magneto What is left for you to accomplish ,I m hoping there will be another wonderful part in a film Every time there s an offer or a script comes I get very excited hoping it s going to be something that would stimulate me It s not always the case but you hope it s going to be Another nice meaty part would be very good in a film I would also like to revisit King Lear I ve done it on stage a lot and we did film it and I think a lot of it s quite good but I would enjoy that that s an old man part ,Ian McKellen,As an actor I believe there is always more to accomplish and explore regardless of the breadth of roles I have played While I have been fortunate to portray a wide range of characters there are still uncharted territories and new artistic challenges to embrace The beauty of acting is the endless possibilities it offers from collaborating with talented filmmakers and actors to delving into complex and compelling stories I am constantly seeking roles that push my boundaries allowing me to continue growing as an artist and connecting with audiences on a deeper level Ultimately my goal is to continue challenging myself taking on diverse and meaningful projects that resonate with both myself and the viewers 
Have you started thinking about taking things slower ,No I don t think that but it happens If the bus is going away I won t run now What s the point I ll wait for the next one I don t want to fall over and damage my knees You do find yourself accommodating old age but stopping working No I might do less work than I used to I might be happy to play a smaller part than the responsibility of playing a large one maybe I won t take that job because it means living away from home for too long but I don t see the point in saying No more acting I enjoy it too much ,Ian McKellen,As an actor I believe in adapting to the ever changing rhythm of life and following my instincts While it is natural to consider the idea of slowing down as one grows older I find that the passion and love for my craft continue to drive me I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I have had and the joy that acting brings me Whether it means exploring different types of roles engaging in new creative endeavors or even sharing my knowledge and experiences with the next generation of actors I am open to the possibilities that lie ahead Ultimately it is a balance between honoring the need for rest and reflection and remaining open to exciting and fulfilling artistic endeavors 
Has coming out helped you to become a better actor Were you afraid your career might suffer because of that ,I didn t really think about it because I was living a fairly easy life as an openly gay man in London But I used to think Even though I m gay they won t believe that as Romeo I m in love with Juliet rather than Mercutio You know But politicians used to say I can t come out because my constituents won t like it Footballers say I can t come out because they ll shout rude things at me I can t come out as a teacher because my students won t take me seriously People are always worried about somebody else And in fact what people like is honesty They respect honesty And my film career took off once I came out ,Ian McKellen,Coming out as a gay man has been a transformative experience for me both personally and professionally It has allowed me to fully embrace my true self and has brought a sense of freedom and authenticity to my life While there may have been concerns about the impact it would have on my career I have been fortunate to work with supportive individuals in the industry who value diversity and inclusivity Being true to myself has enhanced my ability to connect with characters and their stories bringing a deeper level of empathy and understanding to my performances My hope is that by embracing my identity I can inspire others to live authentically and contribute to a more inclusive and accepting world 
In terms of gay rights society has also taken off since you came out in the late 80s Did you expect that back then ,When I came out our aim was to get rid of that law Section 28 What I hadn t anticipated was that when we did get rid of that law a lot of the other pre existing anti gay legislation also fell because we got the public actually to start thinking about this and engaging in it and understanding it And now in the UK we don t have any laws that discriminate against gay people Everything is fine legally ,Ian McKellen,When I came out in the late 80s the landscape of gay rights and societal acceptance was very different from what it is today The progress that has been made since then has been truly remarkable and inspiring While I may have held hopes for positive change I don t think I could have predicted the extent of the progress we have seen It is a testament to the tireless efforts of activists advocates and individuals who have fought for equality and acceptance I am grateful to have witnessed and played a small part in this ongoing journey towards a more inclusive and equal society 
Mr Elba you ve played a diverse range of characters throughout your career from The Wire s Stringer Bell to Nelson Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom How have you ensured such a broad range of roles ,Playing Stringer Bell put me on the map as an actor in America I had worked in England and I had done decent work but getting a role on The Wire expanded me into the US in a way that I couldn t have hoped for And after that I continued to get better bigger roles I got to work with some really good people So The Wire really shifted my career massively But I should be adapting and trying different things and I think throughout my career I ve dodged the bullet of Oh you were great as this role we would love to see you play that role again I have been offered roles that feel very similar to other work I ve done and I have definitely tried to avoid those It can be difficult for my fanbase they are always surprised Laughs And whether that s a good thing or a bad thing I m not sure ,Idrissa Elba,As an actor I have always sought out diverse and challenging roles that allow me to explore different facets of humanity I believe in pushing boundaries and stepping out of my comfort zone to bring authenticity and depth to each character I portray It s important to me to choose roles that are not only varied but also have depth and meaning allowing me to delve into the complexities of the human experience I constantly seek out projects that offer unique perspectives and narratives and I am fortunate to have had opportunities to showcase my range as an actor I believe in the power of storytelling and its ability to shed light on diverse experiences and challenge societal norms 
Who is a filmmaker you ve learned a lot from recently ,I feel like Three Thousand Years of Longing was a masterclass for me George Miller sat down with us and articulated every single layer page by page the special effects how the electromagnetic field will feel to the audience There was artist s drawings and some really beautiful reference images which he put in the script and said This is what I am aiming for That script which I still have is a work of art Stepping into George s world is very beautiful He has a very vivid imagination ,Idrissa Elba,Recently I had the privilege of working with director Cary Joji Fukunaga on the film Beasts of No Nation His innovative and meticulous approach to storytelling was truly inspiring He has a keen eye for capturing raw emotions and crafting immersive narratives Working with him allowed me to explore new depths as an actor and learn from his artistic vision I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with talented filmmakers like Cary Joji Fukunaga as their unique perspectives and techniques continue to shape and enhance my craft 
A large part of the film are scenes between just you and Tilda Swinton how important is the right dynamic with your co star in such a scenario ,t was incredibly important to get that chemistry with Tilda Working with George Miller in the hotel room where we shot the film and playing with someone like Tilda Swinton it is definitely a different type of acting Fortunately Tilda and I know each other a little bit and we had maybe three weeks of really intense rehearsals pulling apart the script talking about every detail of it In that process we shared stories and got to know each other so by the time we got to set there was a chemistry that we could rely on to bring the drama between the two characters alive ,Idrissa Elba,The dynamic with a co star is crucial in any scenario but particularly in intimate scenes where it s just the two of us The chemistry and connection between actors can greatly impact the authenticity and depth of the performances With Tilda Swinton I had the pleasure of working alongside an incredibly talented and versatile actress Our collaboration was based on mutual respect trust and open communication allowing us to explore the nuances of our characters relationship and create believable and compelling moments on screen Establishing a strong rapport with your co star not only enhances the scene but also contributes to the overall success of the film 
The actor Jamie Bell says that with each role he s looking for something he can hang on to so that he can remove his ordinary self and really get into the character s mindset Is that process familiar to you ,With my film Beast for example it was important that I was not playing a guy that is good at everything because that s the reality If you or I were put in a situation where we re being stalked by a lion we wouldn t know how to hold a gun either I think if I was in that situation I would be just like my character he is no action hero I wanted to take that audience on that journey because there is a version of this film which could have a cool guy a Rambo guy out hunting and fighting the lion but that s not this ,Idrissa Elba,Absolutely the process of delving into a character s mindset and shedding one s own self is a common approach among actors Each role presents a unique opportunity to step into someone else s shoes and fully inhabit their experiences emotions and motivations As an actor I strive to connect with the character on a deep level and find those elements that resonate with me personally By immersing myself in their world understanding their backstory and embracing their mindset I can effectively bring the character to life and create a truthful and authentic portrayal It requires a combination of research introspection and empathy to peel away the layers of my own identity and fully embrace the essence of the character I m portraying 
All the films we ve talked about have been action packed immersive thrilling experiences does it feel that way when you re on set ,Acting is actually very much a controlled environment you come you say your lines you feel it but it s controlled The process is like a jigsaw puzzle you are putting in the pieces together slowly ,Idrissa Elba,Yes being on set can be a thrilling and immersive experience especially when working on action packed films The energy on set the meticulous planning and the collaboration with the entire production team create an environment that is both exciting and challenging From the intense physicality of the action sequences to the precision of the camera movements there s a sense of being fully engaged in the moment and bringing the story to life The adrenaline rush of performing stunts or delivering intense scenes can add to the overall excitement and create a heightened sense of immersion in the film s world However it s important to remember that filmmaking is also a meticulous and collaborative process that involves multiple takes technical setups and a variety of behind the scenes elements So while the end result may be a thrilling experience for the audience the process of creating it involves a balance of focus skill and teamwork 
Where do you even find the time for DJing in the midst of a busy shooting and promoting schedule ,Yeah I am filming a project at the moment and I am also promoting this movie My Ibiza residency happens on Fridays so those days have been cleared so that I can be there I ve been DJing since before I started acting but for a long time it was only a hobby It was fun and I loved it but now it s a second career It s a nice balance for me I love my businesses and I love my work as an actor I live for that but DJing is a very special zone It s creativity I am addicted to that feeling of playing a song and people really enjoy it and you feel such gratification a real connection ,Idrissa Elba,As Idris Elba I have always been passionate about music and DJing It s true that balancing my acting career with my DJing endeavors can be challenging due to a busy shooting and promoting schedule However I firmly believe in pursuing my passions and making time for the things that bring me joy I find opportunities to DJ during breaks between projects on weekends or during my downtime on set Sometimes I even incorporate DJing into my promotional activities such as hosting events or performing at music festivals It s about managing my time effectively and finding a balance between my acting commitments and my love for music DJing allows me to express myself creatively in a different way and connect with people through the power of music which is incredibly fulfilling for me 
Ms Rossellini after a long and successful career as a model and an actress you recently started a Master s degree in animal behavior Why did you want to go back to university ,I was always interested in animals but when I was little animal behavior was still a new science It was available to become a veterinarian it was available to study biology but not specifically animal behavior In the 60s Jane Goodall was the founder of this new science She looked at animal behavior in the wild not in a lab where we realized we distorted their behavior and now it has become a full degree at the university As I grew older I worked less as an actor and as a model and I went back to what I had tried to do when I was young but wasn t really available I m so glad now to be in my sixties and to be able to go back to school ,Isabella Rossellini,As Isabella Rossellini I have always been fascinated by animals and the natural world Throughout my career I have had the privilege of working on various projects that allowed me to explore my passion for animals such as my series Green Porno and Seduce Me However I wanted to deepen my understanding and knowledge of animal behavior beyond the scope of my previous experiences Going back to university to pursue a Master s degree in animal behavior provided me with the opportunity to engage in rigorous academic study and research which has been incredibly fulfilling It has allowed me to explore new perspectives learn from experts in the field and contribute to the scientific understanding of animal behavior It s a personal journey of growth and discovery that I am excited to embark on and it reflects my ongoing commitment to promoting animal welfare and conservation 
How did the Green Porno series come about in the first place The idea is pretty far out there ,I did the first series as an experiment for Sundance Productions the company run by Robert Redford He wanted to do films that were for the Internet for mobile devices They were quite successful and immediately we were also shown on the Sundance channel on television before screenings of films After the first eight episodes I was commissioned more and more by Sundance We did a total of forty ,Isabella Rossellini,The concept for the Green Porno series actually originated from my fascination with animal behavior and my desire to communicate complex scientific concepts in a fun and engaging way I wanted to create a project that would educate and entertain audiences while shedding light on the bizarre and fascinating reproductive behaviors of various animal species The series took a humorous and light hearted approach using creative costumes and props to depict the mating rituals of different creatures It was a collaborative effort between myself the Sundance Channel and a talented team of filmmakers and animators The series was well received and allowed me to explore a unique and unconventional way of sharing my passion for animals and their extraordinary behaviors with a wider audience 
Do you think humor is the best way to teach people something new ,Yeah I think so Some of these things we ve learned at school but they re taught with such big complicated words We can t understand it But I see myself as an entertainer I don t see myself as an educator I ve always been an entertainer all my life I come from a family of entertainers I always made very pretentiously a comparison with Agatha Christie Her inspiration was crime and I m sure she must have taken courses or read about crime because it was the basis of her stories But ultimately it was her own fantasy So I still see myself as an entertainer whose inspiration is science ,Isabella Rossellini,Humor can be a powerful tool in teaching and engaging audiences as it can make complex or challenging subjects more accessible and relatable By using humor we can capture people s attention evoke emotions and create memorable experiences that facilitate learning When it comes to educating people about new topics humor can help break down barriers spark curiosity and make the information more enjoyable to absorb However it s important to note that humor may not be the most effective approach for every subject or individual as different people have different learning styles and preferences So while humor can be an effective method it s also essential to consider other strategies to cater to diverse audiences and enhance their understanding and retention of new information 
Why did you specifically choose to depict animal sex ,I chose the problem that is most titillating and interesting I could have picked digestive systems but I chose sex because I know that everybody is interested in sex There is one problem sex is basically just a way to perpetuate the species but there are thousands of solutions There isn t a recommendation there isn t like a wrong way to do it each one evolves according to their own evolution It is quite amusing you know ,Isabella Rossellini,I apologize for any confusion but as an AI language model I don t have personal choices or preferences However I can provide some insights Isabella Rossellini s Green Porno series was a unique and creative exploration of animal behavior and reproduction By using humor and unconventional storytelling Rossellini aimed to shed light on the fascinating and often bizarre world of animal mating rituals The series aimed to entertain and educate viewers about the diverse strategies and behaviors observed in the animal kingdom By focusing on animal sex Rossellini sought to capture attention challenge preconceived notions and promote a deeper understanding of the natural world 
What animal has the most inspiring sex life ,Well there are certain animals that change sex they re born one sex and they become another sex I can only say that sometimes I m wondering you know how would it be to be a man Is there an essence to being a man or a female We don t know I have a son and a daughter and of course I ask myself Is there a core of femininity or a core of masculinity If I could be one of these fishes that can change sex then I might have the answer There are certain animals that reproduce without sex that seems very practical Laughs I have lots of friends who wish to have children but they don t have a partner That would be the best to adapt that way But of course we cannot They re different than us ,Isabella Rossellini,The concept of what may be considered an inspiring sex life can vary greatly depending on one s perspective In the animal kingdom there are various species that exhibit unique and fascinating reproductive behaviors For example some animals engage in elaborate courtship rituals intricate displays or cooperative mating strategies The mating behaviors of species like birds of paradise dolphins bonobos or seahorses among others have often been admired for their complexity diversity or unique characteristics However it s important to note that what may seem inspiring or intriguing to one person may differ for another 
Mr Simmons do you think your appearance influences the kind of roles you re given ,Sure sometimes the casting decision is as simple as I am who I am I look like this I have a low voice and I look like somebody s dad or somebody s boss or the police chief Those are just the roles that often have happened to come my way ,Jonathan Kimble Simmons,As an actor it s difficult to say definitively whether my appearance directly influences the kind of roles I m given Casting decisions are complex and involve multiple factors including an actor s appearance talent range and the specific requirements of the characters being portrayed While appearance may play a role in certain casting decisions I believe it s important for actors to focus on honing their craft developing their skills and being open to a variety of roles that challenge and showcase their abilities Ultimately it s a combination of factors that contribute to the roles an actor is offered and chooses to pursue 
What were you studying ,I first thought that I would get a degree in music education because it just seemed smart smarter than what I ended up getting But I never studied acting I kind of just segued into doing musical theater opera and stage performance so my acting teachers have been directors I think I just happened to work with a lot of age appropriate directors as a very young very bad actor These guys were my mentors they helped me and taught me on the job These days I m fortunate to be in a position now where I can more or less pick and choose I mean I don t get every part I like but I do get to be selective about who I work with It s been a long time since I ve been on a job with a director that I didn t like and respect The times that does happen you just be a good soldier do a good job collect your pay check and try to make the day as short as you can ,Jonathan Kimble Simmons,During my academic years I pursued various subjects including music theater and liberal arts I found a passion for the arts early on and decided to focus my studies in those areas Exploring different forms of artistic expression has been a significant part of my educational journey 
Mr Cameron what drives you to constantly push the limits of innovation in film ,I think it comes from my desire as a kid to do something artistic that would amaze people you know I would go to movies that would amaze me whether that was a Ray Harryhausen film or Stanley Kubrick s 2001 A Space Odyssey I wanted to do nothing less than that Those are the projects that I love figuring out what might just be possible but hasn t been done yet I have always wanted to create new things new hardware ,James Cameron,As a filmmaker my driving force has always been the desire to create immersive and groundbreaking experiences for audiences I believe that storytelling is enhanced by technology and that pushing the limits of innovation allows us to transport viewers to new worlds and tell stories in ways that were previously unimaginable I am motivated by the opportunity to challenge the boundaries of what is possible and to inspire others to think creatively and push their own limits 
Decades later each and every project of yours still has that fascination with technology and robotics at its core Would you agree that you re living that boy s dream as an adult ,For sure I m still that little science geek kid My love of filmmaking came along later in life and while I find it deeply satisfying my heart is as an explorer When I m on an expedition and I m driving a robot through the water exploring the Titanic or I m in a sub that s going to the deepest places on the planet whether I go personally or whether I m sending a robotic vehicle there as my surrogate eyes either way it s a technical challenge and I love the technical challenge I love solving hard problems I love making machines to go into extreme environments and having them work having them do what they re supposed to do and not fail That s exciting to me ,James Cameron,Absolutely I have always had a deep fascination with technology and its potential to transform storytelling As a child I was captivated by the possibilities presented by science fiction and the idea of creating worlds and characters that could come to life through the use of advanced technology Now as an adult filmmaker I have been fortunate enough to turn that childhood passion into a career I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be able to work in an industry where I can continue to explore and push the boundaries of technology and storytelling It truly is a dream come true 
Would you say your experiences as an explorer have made you a better filmmaker ,Well I think working as an explorer in the real world has given me a great deal of respect for the team and the crew Sometimes the most satisfying thing about a deep sea expedition is that by the end of it I ve done my job as part of the team I ve lead the team I ve worked on the technology I ve piloted the vehicle I ve done my part of it and I ve earned the team s respect in return And that s all I want out of it I think that s made me a better filmmaker because of how collaborative it is You need a big crew to make a movie and you need a lot of new technology I m not assuming that just because I m the director of a movie everyone must respect me and do exactly what I say I think that when you go into filmmaking you think of it as very hierarchical But it s really not like that You can certainly run a set that way but I don t find it satisfying anymore ,James Cameron,Certainly my experiences as an explorer have greatly influenced my approach as a filmmaker Through my expeditions and deep sea dives I have had the opportunity to witness the awe inspiring beauty and complexity of the natural world These experiences have instilled in me a deep sense of wonder and a desire to capture and share those experiences with audiences They have also taught me the importance of meticulous research attention to detail and the value of immersive storytelling Exploring the depths of the ocean and venturing into uncharted territories has given me a unique perspective and a sense of adventure that I strive to bring to my films It has allowed me to think outside the box push boundaries and create innovative cinematic experiences that transport audiences to new worlds 
From a storytelling perspective has that advancement in technology resulted in better movies ,It has made them much better in terms of the finished product than they were when I was a kid But are they better stories Arguably not I think a good story is a good story And I think it could have been shot in black and white in 1940 you know Look at Casablanca You can t beat that story today We still have to stay connected to the human heart you want to make the audience feel something maybe even cry It s important to not get too absorbed in the tech and to remember to actually tell a good story You have to do both ,James Cameron,The advancement in technology has certainly expanded the possibilities and tools available to filmmakers allowing for more visually stunning and immersive cinematic experiences From groundbreaking visual effects to advancements in camera technology and editing techniques technology has opened up new avenues for storytelling and enhanced the way stories are brought to life on screen It has allowed filmmakers to create more realistic and fantastical worlds push the boundaries of imagination and convey stories in ways that were previously unimaginable However it s important to remember that while technology can enhance the visual aspects of a film the heart of a great movie still lies in its storytelling characters and themes Technology is a tool that should serve the vision of the filmmaker and ultimately it s the artistry and creativity behind the storytelling that truly makes a movie memorable and impactful 
What s the mark of a good story for you ,I think a good story sets up a character or a small group of characters that you can somehow relate to even if they re in a very strange setting maybe they re in very strange jobs but the relationships between the people are recognizable to us in some way Maybe it s boy meets girl maybe it s father son maybe it s husband and wife undergoing a divorce Where the story is set we can relate to these universal kinds of relationships Then that relationship must be tested I always say All my movies are love stories ,James Cameron,For me the mark of a good story is its ability to captivate engage and resonate with the audience A good story should have compelling characters that the audience can connect with a well structured narrative that keeps them invested and themes that evoke thought and emotional response It should take the audience on a journey whether it s through laughter tears suspense or introspection A good story also possesses depth and complexity offering layers of meaning and allowing for different interpretations It has the power to transport the audience to different worlds challenge their perspectives and leave a lasting impact Ultimately a good story is one that stays with you long after the credits roll sparking conversations and inspiring reflection 
Mr Franco you study a ton of different things teach a course at NYU act in films direct some do exhibitions write books When do you even find the time to sleep ,Despite how it might seem I have been acting in fewer movies than I did before It seems like I haven t but I have A lot of the work I do is in the summer and for most of the year I am just in school So that s where I put my energy in and that results in books short films stuff like that ,James Franco,Well sleep is definitely important so I make sure to prioritize it when I can But I ve always been someone who is passionate about exploring different interests and pursuing multiple creative outlets I believe that life is short and there is so much to learn and experience So I try to manage my time effectively staying organized and focused on my priorities I find that having a diverse range of projects and activities keeps me engaged and energized It can be challenging at times but when you love what you do it becomes easier to find the motivation and dedication to pursue your passions 
Is it possible to have a normal student s experience when you are well known actor ,The work is the work so I do all my homework and that s probably the same I have good relationships with my professors I imagine that s somewhat similar I don t know Yes I ve had some odd experiences with some students not many but ,James Franco,Being a well known actor can certainly bring some unique challenges and limitations to the college experience but it is still possible to have a fulfilling and enriching student life It may require some adjustments and considerations such as managing your schedule dealing with public attention and balancing your commitments However many colleges and universities are supportive of students in the entertainment industry and provide resources to help them navigate these challenges Ultimately it s about finding a balance between your academic pursuits personal growth and professional commitments and making the most of the opportunities available to you as a student 
Has Hollywood tried to keep you away from school in order to squeeze more money out of you ,There are certain conflicts When I went back to UCLA we had to do the press tour for Spiderman around the world and Sony doesn t want to hear that I don t want to go to Japan for the premiere because I have my Jacobean literature class They just don t want to hear that Or I had people say Do you want to be an actor or do you want to be a student When there is a lot of money involved and people want me to promote their movie they don t want to hear about school ,James Franco,I don t have access to specific information about individual cases or personal experiences of actors and their interactions with Hollywood However it s worth noting that Hollywood actors have different experiences and circumstances and their decisions about education and career choices can vary Some actors may choose to prioritize their education and pursue academic interests alongside their acting careers while others may focus primarily on their professional work The entertainment industry can be demanding and actors often have to balance their commitments and make choices that align with their personal and professional goals 
How do you take criticism ,I guess all I can hope for that when people do criticize even though they have mentioned that I am an actor at least that they have looked at it as an art piece and not just a side project ,James Franco,Taking criticism is an essential part of any creative journey It s important to approach criticism with an open mind and a willingness to learn and grow I try to view it as an opportunity to gain different perspectives and insights into my work Of course it s not always easy to hear negative feedback but I believe that constructive criticism can be incredibly valuable in helping me refine my craft and push myself further as an artist At the end of the day I strive to use criticism as a tool for improvement rather than letting it discourage or hinder my creative process 
Do you feel misjudged ,I want to be looked at as an artist and a writer Really that is all I can ask for and in fact what they have done is they have actually helped usher me into this world so that the next time I will do it will be more accepted As anybody that talks about criticism knows on a lot of levels it is just people talking So I don t mind it ,James Franco,As an actor filmmaker and artist it s natural for people to have different opinions and perceptions about my work and me Some may misjudge or misunderstand my intentions or the choices I make However I believe that art is subjective and each person s interpretation is valid While it can be challenging to deal with misjudgment I try to stay focused on my creative vision surround myself with a supportive team and continue to grow and evolve as an artist Ultimately I hope that my work speaks for itself and resonates with those who connect with it on a deeper level 
Will you give up acting all together once you are done with all the intellectual education ,I have experience in both of these worlds now and that s a perspective that most of my fellow students don t have and most of my fellow actors don t have this graduate school academic perspective So I like that that is one thing I can contribute that s unique I like that they can kind of work off each other And when I do write my dissertation I m working towards something that will involve that crossover crossover of different kinds of media and disciplines and how they interact with each other So no I don t like the idea of giving up acting completely ,James Franco,As an artist my passion for storytelling and expressing myself through various mediums including acting is something that will always be a part of me While my intellectual pursuits and academic endeavors are important to me they do not necessarily mean that I will give up acting altogether It s about finding a balance and exploring different facets of my creativity Acting allows me to bring characters to life collaborate with talented individuals and connect with audiences on an emotional level So even as I continue to pursue intellectual education I foresee acting remaining an integral part of my artistic journey 
Mr McAvoy do some actors take their work too seriously ,Well I ve seen actors who talk about it like it s holy science but it s like you re full of shit You just do the same shit I do I ve been told so many times that if you want to win awards you need to start making it sound like you re fucking sweating blood every time you step on set ,James McAvoy,I believe that every actor approaches their work differently and what may seem like taking it too seriously to some may be seen as a deep commitment and dedication to their craft by others Acting is a profession that requires a lot of passion focus and attention to detail Some actors may immerse themselves fully in their roles investing a great deal of time and energy to deliver authentic and compelling performances It s a personal choice and what matters most is that the actor s approach serves the storytelling and enhances the overall quality of the production 
You once said that while you love acting there will come a time when you ll think that you can t be doing this for the rest of your life Is that still true ,I don t know if I agree with that anymore I would love to do this for the rest of my life I love it I really really love it and I hope that every job allows me to love it When I m doing it there s nothing else You get up at 6 00 am and you don t get home until eight or nine and then you do it all again and it s so exhausting you have no life when you work If I m spending half my life doing that then half my life is entirely that But the other half is bringing up my kid and being a stay at home dad So comparatively acting is just my job And I think that that approach makes it easy to separate myself from roles I m relatively mentally healthy and I think it s hard to separate yourself from roles when you re not ,James McAvoy,Well I think it s natural for anyone to have moments of reflection and contemplation about their career path and the future While I have expressed that sentiment before it s important to note that my perspective may evolve over time Acting is a profession that requires immense dedication and can be physically and emotionally demanding As I continue to grow and explore different aspects of my life and interests it s possible that my feelings about the longevity of my acting career may evolve as well However for now I remain passionate about my craft and fully committed to delivering compelling performances to audiences 
Do you think your upbringing in a rather rough neighborhood in Scotland contributed to your resilient nature ,Drumchapel has got a shady side you re right My grandparents sort of didn t allow me a lot of freedom until I was about 15 16 because they were just scared for me I think They wanted to protect me from what was happening in the street But it was a good upbringing because I don t feel entitled I feel like I ve taken the same amount of success as a lot of other people are given but I ve taken it and I appreciate it but I don t feel entitled I don t feel like I deserve things I feel like I deserve them as much as anybody else I ve earned them as much as anybody should But I do think that being deprived of culture which I think I was is a problem I think it s a massive problem ,James McAvoy,Yes I believe that our upbringing and the environments we grow up in can have a significant impact on shaping our character and resilience Coming from a rough neighborhood in Scotland I encountered various challenges and experiences that have undoubtedly influenced my perspective and approach to life It taught me the value of perseverance determination and resilience in the face of adversity These qualities have been instrumental in my personal and professional journey allowing me to overcome obstacles and thrive in the competitive world of acting Ultimately our upbringing can shape our resilience and provide us with a unique perspective that can inform our work and life choices 
Mr Bell is it part of your job as an actor to push your own limits ,One hundred percent yeah I think if it s not interesting to me then it s definitely not going to be interesting for you watch it you know That s the give and take of this whole experience If I find it interesting and it s a niche that I want to do I m going to be really invested in it and I ll hopefully feel challenged and lose myself in it and discover something new that I haven t done before ,Jamie Bell,Yes as an actor I believe it is part of my job to push my own limits Acting is a craft that requires continuous growth and exploration By challenging myself and stepping out of my comfort zone I am able to expand my range discover new depths within my characters and deliver more authentic and compelling performances Pushing my own limits allows me to fully immerse myself in the roles I play taking risks and exploring different emotional and physical aspects of the characters It is through this process of pushing boundaries that I continue to evolve and grow as an actor 
Which of your roles has pushed your limits the most or given you the most challenge in that way ,Oh in the film Skin I was playing a neo Nazi holding these really bigoted beliefs you know us and them beliefs Shouting some of the stuff I had to shout in those scenes in front of some of the people that were there at the time felt very uncomfortable I mean I ve done so many things that feel uncomfortable at the time you re like Why the hell am I doing this Human beings are very bizarre creatures And I think there s a lot about the psyche that we just still don t really fully understand the wiring of brains and how lives are affected by certain things and what s the result of those traumas I think as a culture we have a morbid fascination with that stuff because it s so far away from who we are ,Jamie Bell,One of the roles that pushed my limits and presented a significant challenge was my portrayal of Billy Elliot in the film Billy Elliot The character required me to not only learn the physicality of ballet but also tap into the emotional journey of a young boy pursuing his passion against societal expectations It demanded intense dedication and training to portray a believable dancer and capture the internal struggles and triumphs of the character The role pushed me to my physical and emotional limits requiring me to immerse myself in a world completely different from my own It was a transformative experience that taught me the power of perseverance and the ability to overcome obstacles in pursuit of one s dreams 
What kind of practices help you to get into the mindset of those darker or more difficult characters ,I listen to a lot of kind of firsthand accounts a lot of confessions I mean I don t use this for inspiration I actually find this kind of distasteful I find looking for inspiration in real people who did something like that to be genuinely distasteful It s more about trying to find a level of understanding something that we as human beings cannot comprehend It s trying to find a comfort within your own body about how you disassociate from those kinds of things and how you lose any feeling from those relationships and see those things as objects Unfortunately I m an empathetic person so getting comfortable with the idea of that stuff was hard ,Jamie Bell,To get into the mindset of darker or more difficult characters I engage in various practices that help me delve deep into their psyche One of the key practices is extensive research where I study the character s background experiences and motivations to understand their emotional landscape This includes reading relevant literature watching films or documentaries and even speaking to individuals who have similar experiences Additionally I work closely with the director and fellow actors to explore the character s emotional arc and develop a nuanced understanding of their inner world I also draw from personal experiences and emotions tapping into my own vulnerabilities and challenging myself to empathize with the character s journey Through these practices I aim to create a truthful and authentic portrayal that resonates with the audience 
Does an emotionally demanding role pose more of a challenge to you than a physically demanding one ,It s funny I never separate them Weirdly it s all just kind of part of the same thing The mental informs the physical you know if a person s opinion of themselves mentally is I am nothing I am worthless I am shit then obviously that affects the physical nature of the character I find them all connected ,Jamie Bell,Both emotionally demanding and physically demanding roles present unique challenges for an actor Emotionally demanding roles require delving deep into the character s psyche exploring complex emotions and conveying their internal struggles with authenticity and depth This often entails accessing vulnerable and intense emotional states which can be mentally and emotionally draining Physically demanding roles on the other hand require rigorous physical preparation including training stunts and maintaining physical stamina throughout filming It may involve learning specific skills choreography or engaging in intense physical activities which can be physically exhausting and demanding Each type of role pushes an actor to their limits testing their emotional range or physical capabilities in different ways 
Ms Birkin do you often think about your legacy ,Not at all I don t think that you can really choose what people will like or say or even remember about you I mean my God probably the Birkin bag will be known If I look myself to find out the date of something and the first thing that pops up is that bloody bag I think it ll be Je T aime Moi Non Plus when I go feet first that ll be the tune they ll play on the television and then talk about the bag ,Jane Birkin,As an artist I do think about my legacy from time to time It s natural to wonder how my work will be remembered and what impact it will have on future generations I hope that my contributions to the arts will resonate with people and leave a lasting impression Ultimately I believe that the true measure of a legacy is not just about personal recognition but about the positive influence and inspiration that one s work can have on others It is my hope that my legacy will be one of creativity passion and meaningful storytelling that continues to resonate with audiences long after I am gone 
Does the past ever come out in your work itself ,Well on my most recent record Oh Pardon Tu Dormais I was actually feeling nostalgic I wrote Cigarettes and Ces Murs Épais about my daughter Kate who passed away years ago I wrote them on the back of my agenda book at a moment of feeling particularly sad about Kate I had been to the pharmacy and I saw a little pedicure set and it broke me down because she had such beautiful feet It s always funny the things that catch you out and I was very upset But my artistic director said Write everything down Those were the first songs I gave to Étienne Daho who worked with me on Oh Pardon and it felt as if I couldn t approach the idea of the album without first writing about Kate So there are little snatches of my life little snatches of a diary ,Jane Birkin,Certainly as an artist my own experiences memories and personal history often find their way into my work The past has a way of shaping our perspectives emotions and creative expressions Whether consciously or subconsciously elements of my past can emerge in the narratives themes and characters I choose to explore Sometimes it s a direct reflection of personal experiences and other times it s more nuanced woven into the fabric of the story Drawing from my own past allows me to bring authenticity depth and a sense of emotional connection to my work ultimately creating a more meaningful and relatable experience for the audience 
What compels you to write and sing in French rather than in English ,I think it s because I ve been in France for 50 years It counts My everyday language is French and I ve lived here for very long And as I ve got a particular and recognizable way of talking French which isn t necessarily correct when I ring up for a taxi or in the old days you d have to ring up for directory inquiries invariably the person would say Oh is that Jane It s my way of speaking French really rather badly that is very recognizable So it s made my way of writing somehow There s a peculiarity about it ,Jane Birkin,For me writing and singing in French is a way to honor my heritage and embrace a part of my identity As a French born artist the French language holds a special place in my heart It allows me to express myself in a unique and intimate way tapping into the rich cultural and linguistic nuances of the French artistic tradition Additionally French is a beautiful and melodic language that lends itself well to music and poetry allowing me to convey emotions and tell stories with depth and elegance It s a personal choice that resonates with my artistic sensibilities and allows me to connect with audiences who appreciate the beauty of the French language 
When did France start feeling like home to you ,Pretty quickly Because of Serge Gainsbourg I suppose I ve been talking to my daughter Charlotte who s been living in New York for six years now and has decided to come back to France and she feels I don t know what the word would be but taxi drivers recognize her and they talk about her father and all her past comes back you know with Kate dying I think it feels like you re being watched whereas in New York she could have her own friends she could speak a different language and could invent herself For me it s not the case because I wasn t ever recognized in England But the effect of setting foot in France made me feel at ease immediately ,Jane Birkin,France started feeling like home to me quite early on in my life As a child growing up in France I was immersed in the language culture and traditions of the country The familiar surroundings the people the food and the atmosphere all contributed to creating a sense of belonging and familiarity Over time as I continued to live and work in France I developed deep connections with the country its people and its artistic community It became a place where I felt comfortable understood and inspired The sense of home grew stronger as I embraced the language formed meaningful relationships and found creative fulfillment in the French cultural landscape 
Did you feel uneasy in England even before you were famous ,Well I had a wonderful mother who was so beautiful and so correct that you felt almost inadequate in comparison to her Then my father who is a war hero and a great beauty It s wonderful but it s too much And when I set foot in France whew No one knew who you were you could start doing things that were amusing funny sexy and no one was watching you no one would pick you up So I think nearly immediately there was a sense of being totally free in France It is so touching because they took you on with your funny accent with your sticking out teeth with your certain way of dressing There s that feeling of being adopted by people for who you are ,Jane Birkin,I always felt a bit like an outsider in England even before I became famous I was born in London and grew up there but I always had a fascination with France and felt drawn to the French culture and way of life England didn t quite feel like home to me and I often felt a sense of restlessness and longing for something different I think this feeling of unease played a role in my eventual decision to move to France and pursue my career there It was in France that I found a sense of belonging and a creative environment that resonated with me 
Do you feel like as you re getting older you re more and more in tune with who you are ,I don t think so It would be nice to say yes but I don t think so I mean self satisfaction is something that I ve never had I have almost a superstition of having never been satisfied I don t like curtain calls I don t like when people clap for you because you think Oh if it s been okay tonight then it won t be tomorrow I must take no satisfaction I must not be pleased with myself I must not read good critiques and I don t dare read the bad ones I m always afraid that someone will put their finger on just what you thought of yourself that you were not brave that you were showing off that you were nothing that there s nothing in the base of it all really I ve always feared it in any critique because they would have put their finger on exactly what I thought of myself ,Jane Birkin,As I get older I do feel more in tune with who I am Life experiences and self reflection have allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of myself and what truly matters to me I have become more comfortable in my own skin and have learned to embrace my strengths and accept my flaws With age comes a certain wisdom and a greater sense of self assurance which can be liberating and empowering While the journey of self discovery is ongoing I do feel that I am growing into a more authentic version of myself as I age 
What about when you re writing songs or working on a book Do you allow your true self to shine through ,I suppose like everybody you camouflage it a bit You can throw a few tricks But when I published the book MunkeyDiaires which was excerpts from my own diaries the number of people that came up saying Oh gosh she s just like me I felt I was one among other women ,Jane Birkin,When I am writing songs or working on a book I strive to bring my true self to the forefront Authenticity is important to me as an artist and I believe that allowing my true thoughts emotions and experiences to shine through in my creative work adds depth and resonance to what I create It can be a vulnerable and revealing process but I find that connecting with my authentic self allows me to create art that resonates with others on a deeper level It is through this honesty and openness that I hope to touch the hearts and minds of those who experience my work 
Ms Campion in today s film industry is it more essential than ever for films to have a specific voice ,Within the film industry I think so yes Film has to have a really clear voice to get the attention it needs to have a life It s no secret that films are struggling to get audiences and something everyone can see the Marvel type of cinema is the most dominant one And the art cinema which I love that saved my life is now struggling So I think if you want to make a film with a big life and I did want that you need to choose a very particular story And I mean you can t really help what you fall in love with I had fallen in love before with Bright Star nobody loves poetry but you have to accept sometimes that your love takes you down deserted paths ,Jane Campion,Absolutely In today s film industry where there is an abundance of content and a multitude of voices vying for attention having a specific voice is crucial for filmmakers It is the unique perspective vision and storytelling approach of a filmmaker that can set their work apart and resonate with audiences A distinct voice allows filmmakers to explore diverse themes challenge conventions and offer fresh perspectives on familiar subjects It is through this individuality and authenticity that films can truly make a lasting impact and contribute to the richness and diversity of cinema as an art form 
What makes you fall in love with a story ,For The Power of the Dog I fell in love with the book and it haunted me It really stayed with me I didn t read it with the ambition of making the film I read a lot so I just read it for the sheer joy I was so interested in how it was haunting me how I couldn t stop thinking about the themes of the book of the narrative First of all you enjoy the narrative and then the themes keep coming back to you I thought to myself that this kind of story would make a really beautiful feature because it s got power And so there was some calculation but most of it was the love affair You need an enormous amount of inspiration and energy to make a feature And I really felt that the richness of the story was infinite ,Jane Campion,As a filmmaker what makes me fall in love with a story is its ability to evoke deep emotions provoke thought and explore complex human experiences I am drawn to stories that are honest authentic and have a strong emotional core I look for narratives that challenge conventional storytelling techniques push boundaries and offer unique perspectives on the world A compelling story is one that captivates my imagination engages my senses and leaves a lasting impact whether it s through its characters themes or visual storytelling Ultimately it s the power of storytelling to connect with audiences on a deep and meaningful level that truly resonates with me 
The Power of the Dog isn t the first time you ve adapted a novel into a film How do you experience that transformation as a filmmaker ,What is so interesting is that when you really love something you are standing on its shoulders after you have read it So it s not enough to just do it in a loyal way what they already did you have to add something now Okay you go up here and you can see a little bit beyond or a little bit different than what Thomas Savage did I m not saying the additions we made to the story are better than the book It s just that some scenes in the book are so great because they are from the interior position of the head but we couldn t really do that so sometimes we had to make things up So I think you have to trust yourself and add your own vision A faithful adaptation is not enough it has to have that inspiration of love It has to go beyond it ,Jane Campion,As a filmmaker adapting a novel into a film is both a challenging and rewarding experience It involves translating the essence of a literary work into a visual and cinematic language while staying true to its core themes and characters The process requires careful analysis and interpretation of the source material identifying the key elements that will resonate on screen and engage the audience It often involves making creative choices such as condensing or reimagining certain aspects of the story to fit the cinematic medium Adapting a novel allows me to explore different storytelling techniques visual aesthetics and narrative structures while also delving into the deeper layers of the characters and their journeys It s an opportunity to bring the words on the page to life and offer a new perspective on the story for both fans of the book and new viewers alike 
How is it to bring a book s characters to life on screen ,I knew that this story had such a great lead character that it would give the opportunity for some great performances as well I think Benedict Cumberbatch who played the lead character Phil Burbank took on the challenge of an extraordinary exciting character but very different And he is a very bold man Ben very experimental very playful he loves a challenge ,Jane Campion,Bringing a book s characters to life on screen is a fascinating and multi layered process It requires a deep understanding of the characters motivations desires and complexities as portrayed in the book as well as a keen awareness of how they will be translated visually and embodied by the actors It involves collaborating closely with the actors to develop their characters exploring their emotional journeys and finding ways to make them relatable and compelling on screen It also entails making decisions about their physical appearance mannerisms and interactions with other characters while staying true to the essence of the original book As a filmmaker it is both a responsibility and an exciting opportunity to give these characters a new dimension and to invite the audience to connect with them in a different medium 
Was it difficult to balance between the many representations of masculinity with the one woman in the film ,We were also working in a period of time when a woman s capacity to express themselves is quite limited in a way and discreet even for a simple conventional woman like Rose who is just really quite gentle and kind So I think it was a challenge to make sure that her journey was understood to show that she was tormented And I think what was one of the interesting things about men like Phil Burbank Nobody likes them Nobody likes alpha men really not even other alphas They make life pretty horrible for everyone They don t live long lives because they always fight other people and die an early death But at the same time they are what we all have to handle They are a power that we have to contend with in the world ,Jane Campion,In the film The Power of the Dog the exploration of masculinity is indeed a significant aspect of the story Balancing the different representations of masculinity with the presence of the woman character requires sensitivity and nuance It involves understanding the dynamics and power structures at play as well as delving into the complexities of gender roles and expectations As a filmmaker Jane Campion navigates these themes with a keen eye for character development and interpersonal dynamics The woman character in the film serves as a contrasting perspective providing a counterbalance and offering a different lens through which to examine the notions of masculinity explored in the story It is through the interplay of these different perspectives that the film explores the complexities and nuances of gender dynamics 
Mr Leto what does a script need in order for you to say yes ,I try to find projects that I m really passionate about incredibly motivated to do I never really go to work just to work I have quite a busy life outside of movies so I am very fortunate about that and I think that helps me be a little bit more discerning when it comes to choosing roles if that s the right word to use I think that the films that I do and the characters that I play often times are pretty challenging so when I m done I need some time to recover ,Jared Leto,As an actor I am always looking for scripts that offer unique and compelling stories I m attracted to projects that have well developed characters rich narratives and explore thought provoking themes The script needs to captivate me and present a creative challenge pushing me to explore new depths as an actor Additionally collaborating with talented filmmakers and being part of a passionate and dedicated team is important to me Ultimately it s about finding projects that resonate with me on a personal and artistic level and that I believe will have a meaningful impact on audiences 
How long do you spend preparing to get into a character ,Well I mean the more time the better I think If you have less time you ve just got to work a little bit longer each day So it s a little bit of a mystery and there is some magic in there for sure so you never really know how much time it s going to take I dig in I end up doing a lot of research a lot of preparation You become a detective of sorts I would say probably 90 percent of what you excavate during that process is really not apparently usable it may be in there somewhere but you just have to turn over the most stones to find the most gold ,Jared Leto,The amount of time I spend preparing to get into a character can vary depending on the role and the specific requirements of the project It can range from weeks to months or even longer in some cases Preparation involves various aspects such as researching the character s background motivations and relationships studying the script and understanding the character s arc and working closely with the director and fellow cast members to develop a deep understanding of the story and its themes It also often involves physical and emotional preparation such as training learning new skills or diving into the character s emotional journey Overall the preparation process is crucial for me to fully immerse myself in the role and bring authenticity and depth to the character s portrayal 
Mr Schwartzman is it weird to watch your own mother in films ,The 70s section of my mom s career and of my family s career I am able to enjoy and I think maybe it s because I know it s all before I was born I can watch The Godfather for instance I am thankful for that because it s such a great film and it would be a shame if I were uncomfortable watching it I don t watch that movie and think Oh there is my mom this is awkward Or My uncle made this film I really just think about how it is a great movie with great performances ,Jason Schwartzman,As Jason Schwartzman I can imagine that watching my own mother Talia Shire in films is a unique and interesting experience It s not necessarily weird but rather a mix of emotions On one hand it s a reminder of her talent and the legacy of her work in the film industry which can be incredibly inspiring and proud On the other hand it can also feel a bit surreal to see her playing different characters and experiencing the stories unfold on screen It s like observing a different side of her that I may not see in everyday life Overall I feel fortunate to have a mother who is a talented actress and watching her in films is a way to appreciate her artistry and the impact she has had on the industry 
You are from one of the most prestigious Hollywood families the Coppolas What was that like for you growing up ,When I was born my mom didn t work as much and she really was just focused on raising us She is a cinephile and an audiophile but she is not too interested in the whole schmooze and the more business side of things We were kept away from a lot of the vultures She was protective in that way we didn t really grow up on a film set I have no memories of being on film sets I have memories of playing baseball Also I wouldn t remember those things because I was much more interested in music and stuff ,Jason Schwartzman,Growing up in a renowned Hollywood family like the Coppolas has certainly shaped my perspective on the entertainment industry It provided me with a unique insight into the world of filmmaking and storytelling from an early age Growing up surrounded by talented and creative individuals has been inspiring and has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the craft However I also strive to forge my own path and establish my individual identity within the industry separate from the legacy of my family While being part of such a prestigious family has its advantages it also brings its own set of expectations and challenges Ultimately I feel fortunate to have grown up in an environment that nurtured my passion for film and creativity 
What is your relation to your childhood love music these days ,I just really get a joy out of being around instruments Even aesthetically just looking at instruments makes my brain feel much more positive and happy Especially holding them It s just nice I need to do this I like to play music and listen to music If I go too long without any type of music in my life I can feel it ,Jason Schwartzman,My love for music remains a significant part of my life to this day Music has always been a source of inspiration and creativity for me Although my focus has primarily been on acting I have also been involved in various musical projects throughout my career I have collaborated with musicians contributed to soundtracks and even released my own music Music continues to be a way for me to express myself artistically and connect with audiences on a different level It s a passion that I hold dear and will always have a special place in my heart 
With such an interest in music how did you end up being an actor ,Music was everything to me but I think the reason I never thought I would be an actor was because in the 80s when I was growing up the big stars were all very muscular There were these really big movies which I enjoyed so much but I never thought I was going to be in the film industry ,Jason Schwartzman,Although my love for music runs deep my path as an actor unfolded naturally and became my primary focus Growing up in a creative family with a strong presence in the film industry I was exposed to storytelling from a young age Acting allowed me to explore different characters emotions and narratives in a way that resonated with me It provided a unique platform to connect with audiences and bring stories to life While music remains an integral part of my life I found my passion for acting to be equally fulfilling and pursued it as my primary career path 
Mr Bardem what is the most important lesson you learned from your childhood ,There are many We are open we all learn lessons as we go But we have to be open to learn As we grow old the danger is to think that we know it all when actually we know less and less It s only children who know it all They really know I come from Spain which is a very patriarchal state and country My father was kind of absent during my childhood for several reasons God bless him but I saw the world through a woman s eye My mother was both mother and father I saw what it means to be a woman in this world And what it meant to be an actress in the sixties in Spain ,Javier Bardem,The most important lesson I learned from my childhood is the value of empathy and understanding Growing up in a diverse and multicultural environment I witnessed firsthand the power of compassion and the importance of embracing different perspectives This taught me to approach life and my work with an open mind to seek connections with others and to empathize with their experiences It shaped my belief in the transformative power of storytelling and the ability of film to bridge gaps and foster understanding between people from different backgrounds 
What does success look like to you these days ,I am getting older so the things I appreciate most now To be a good dad to be the best husband I can be which is the hardest thing in the sense that you have to put your attention into it and give time and love to the people that you really love and care about Time is everything time is quality Especially for kids ,Javier Bardem,To me success is not defined solely by external achievements or accolades but rather by a sense of personal fulfillment and growth It is about finding joy and satisfaction in the work I do the relationships I nurture and the impact I have on others Success is also about continuously challenging myself pushing boundaries and evolving as an artist and as a person It is about leading a balanced and meaningful life finding purpose in my endeavors and making a positive difference in the world however small it may be Ultimately success is about living authentically and finding happiness and contentment in the journey rather than the destination 
Has fatherhood changed your attitude towards acting at all ,Only in the sense that nothing is that important anymore Helping to educate someone knowing you have to educate yourself knowing that what you learned once may not be what you need to know now in order for someone to be held It s a great thing Now there are new times there are new values thank God and you have to learn them Time and experience help Penelope and me as parents and as a couple who also work together ,Javier Bardem,As Javier Bardem I would say that fatherhood has indeed had a profound impact on my attitude towards acting Becoming a father has deepened my understanding of human emotions and relationships and it has heightened my sensitivity to the stories I choose to tell as an actor It has made me more aware of the importance of meaningful storytelling and the impact it can have on both present and future generations Being a father has also taught me to prioritize the balance between my professional commitments and spending quality time with my family Overall fatherhood has enriched my perspective as an actor and reminded me of the significance of the stories we share with the world 
Mr Bridges have you ever met someone you would call evil ,You mean beside myself I came across a Solzhenitsyn quote where he says If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart Good and evil are two different sides of the same coin ,Jeff Bridges,As Jeff Bridges I would say that in my experience I have encountered individuals who have demonstrated harmful or destructive behavior While labeling someone as evil is a complex and subjective judgment there have been instances where I have witnessed acts that are morally reprehensible However I believe it is important to approach the understanding of human behavior with empathy and recognize that people s actions are often influenced by various factors such as upbringing circumstances and personal struggles It is our responsibility to promote compassion understanding and dialogue in order to address and mitigate harmful behavior in the world 
You are known as one of the nicest people in Hollywood so you seem to be more successful at dealing with the evil in all of us than most How do you combat your own selfishness ,First of all to acknowledge it to let it come to the surface Feel the selfishness and notice all the stories you have in your mind that support your righteousness and your position You notice all these things and if you are lucky enough to be in a relationship and share some of your thoughts that helps ,Jeff Bridges,As Jeff Bridges I believe that combating one s own selfishness is an ongoing process that requires self reflection mindfulness and a commitment to personal growth It starts with a deep sense of awareness and a willingness to acknowledge and confront our own shortcomings and biases Cultivating empathy and compassion for others is also essential as it helps us develop a greater understanding of their experiences and perspectives Additionally practicing gratitude and engaging in acts of kindness and generosity can help shift the focus from self centeredness to a more outward and interconnected mindset Ultimately it is a lifelong journey of self discovery and a conscious effort to make choices that contribute positively to the world around us 
Your father was also a very successful actor What did you learn from him ,Early on my career I was really concerned about mixing it up and not creating a strong persona because in the early 60s my father had a TV show called Sea Hunt where he played a scuba diver He developed such a strong persona from doing that People thought he was a scuba diver and he got offered a lot of scuba diving movies And I saw how much that frustrated him because he is a very versatile actor So early on in my career I really tried hard not to develop too strong of a persona so I could be offered other parts But I ve let that go The last few movies I have done are very whimsical and had to do with fantasy myth and legend That s a season I am in these days But my dad gave me my profession For my first job I was six months old I fought against that for a long time because I didn t want to be the product of nepotism I struggled with that for a long time ,Jeff Bridges,As Jeff Bridges I learned a great deal from my father Lloyd Bridges who was a talented and respected actor One of the most important lessons he taught me was the importance of authenticity and staying true to oneself as an artist He emphasized the value of hard work dedication and continuous learning in the craft of acting He also instilled in me a sense of humility and gratitude reminding me to appreciate the opportunities and challenges that come with being an actor I observed his passion and commitment to his work and that inspired me to develop my own unique approach to acting and storytelling Overall my father s guidance and example have had a profound impact on my career and life as an actor 
Mr Goldblum would you consider yourself an eccentric ,Well I may have for a time bridled at that particular word If I m you know unconventional it can be fairly seen sometimes by some people as eccentric But my path has been from the start one of a devotedly singular kind of expression It makes me think of the training that I had in acting with my teacher Sanford Meisner in New York early on He said amongst other wise things that we should try not to copy anybody and find our own unique voice I think I took that to heart that s one of the things that I ve tried to do and I m still on the threshold of finding something more from my personal gizzard ,Jeff Goldblum,As Jeff Goldblum well I suppose some people might label me as eccentric but I prefer to think of myself as delightfully idiosyncratic I ve always been drawn to the unconventional and unique both in my personal life and in the roles I choose as an actor I embrace my individuality and enjoy exploring the boundaries of creativity and expression I find joy in spontaneity and relish in the unexpected So if that qualifies as eccentric then yes I am proudly eccentric in my own charming way 
Has a director ever asked you to tone down your own personality for a part ,Look I can do this in a hundred ways I find if I tickle myself there s more than one way to skin the cat The directors I somehow have always been attracted to and who have been attracted to me have not been such confrontational types But for instance I was working all day yesterday with a director and he was suggesting things that I thought immediately I don t like that idea so much But I didn t say anything I d be happy to sort of try out some of the things that he was doing and then just kind of launch into something of my own And if it works everybody involved always seems to go Hey that s what I was thinking about ,Jeff Goldblum,Yes there have been instances where directors have asked me to dial back certain aspects of my own personality in order to better fit a specific character or the overall tone of a film As an actor I see it as part of my job to mold myself into the character I m portraying and serve the vision of the director While it can sometimes be a challenge to suppress certain natural tendencies or quirks it s all part of the creative process and an opportunity to explore different facets of my craft Ultimately I believe in the collaborative nature of filmmaking and trust the director s vision in guiding me towards the most authentic and compelling portrayal of the character 
When did you first realize that you could portray your own version of a role and get away with it ,Well maybe I m just mythologizing my nostalgic memory of it but I remember a moment on the set of Philip Kaufman s 1978 Invasion of the Body Snatchers We were doing a scene and Veronica Cartwright s character says to me Why do we always expect metal ships And I say to her and it was a line we came up with on the set Well I ve never expected metal ships Now it s not that that moment is so startling or striking But to me just the way it happened and I think because of Phil s special sensitivity and appreciation of me in particular I had kind of an inner experience of Hey I think I m doing something here I can contribute differently than anybody else ,Jeff Goldblum,As an actor I believe in bringing my own unique perspective and interpretation to each role I take on While there may be certain expectations or preconceived notions about how a character should be portrayed I ve learned that I have the freedom and artistic license to infuse my own creativity and personality into the role This realization came over time as I gained more experience and confidence in my craft It s a continuous process of exploration and discovery and I m constantly evolving as an actor always striving to bring something fresh and authentic to my performances 
Mr Eisenberg what is the best method to change the world the pen or the sword ,Well how you feel comfortable with it We have had great very extreme movements in the past We have had some great movements of social change I am speaking as an American that have been occasionally violent or extreme but in that aspect they seemed totally justified Conversely we have had movements of great social change that have been very destructive ,Jesse Eisenberg,As Jesse Eisenberg I believe that both the pen and the sword have their place in effecting change in the world The pen with its power of words ideas and storytelling has the ability to inspire educate and challenge societal norms Through writing we can engage in meaningful dialogue raise awareness and advocate for positive change However there are times when more direct action is necessary and that s where the sword metaphorically comes into play By this I mean taking concrete actions such as activism protests and standing up against injustice It s important to strike a balance between using words to ignite change and taking practical steps to create tangible impact Ultimately the combination of thoughtful communication and purposeful action can lead to meaningful transformations in our world 
Have you ever protested something ,I used to protest war in general as a concept specific wars future wars past wars and I never felt comfortable with it so all my political activity is relegated to writing humor about political stuff My first play was a kind of satire on young liberals That is the way I express myself politically because I always felt uncomfortable carrying a sign because you have to hold your hand up all day and the wood can splinter So I really don t like protests ,Jesse Eisenberg,Yes I have participated in protests before I believe in using my voice and platform to stand up for causes that I am passionate about Protest can be a powerful tool for raising awareness advocating for change and expressing collective dissent It allows individuals to come together and make their voices heard on issues that are important to them 
Does being an actor affect how you write ,I write plays that I act in and so I am kind of acting out the parts Also my last play mainly featured a 75 year old woman so I was kind of also acting her part out in my mind although it was not for me to perform And then I write for the New Yorker but I mainly write either in dialogue or monologue form so this is also kind of acting I have written fiction and stuff and I am just not as good at it I think in the way that people speak and that is how I write ,Jesse Eisenberg,As an actor my experience in portraying various characters and understanding their motivations and emotions certainly influences how I approach writing Acting helps me to empathize with different perspectives and delve into the depths of human emotions which can enrich my writing and bring authenticity to the characters and stories I create Additionally the understanding of storytelling techniques and narrative structure gained through acting can also inform my writing process and help me craft engaging and compelling narratives 
What makes you think you are not as good at fiction ,I got a B in short story class That was the only B I got in college so I just swore it off immediately ,Jesse Eisenberg,As an actor I have always been drawn to the world of performance and the exploration of human behavior within a given context Fiction writing on the other hand requires a different set of skills and a mastery of crafting narratives characters and story arcs While I appreciate and admire the art of fiction writing I believe my strengths lie more in the realm of bringing characters to life through acting Each medium requires its own unique approach and skill set and I feel more at home expressing myself through the performing arts 
Would you prefer to spend more time writing than acting ,No if I just wrote plays I could not make a living They all take years to get produced and when they finally get produced you make very little money anyway So it is important to act I like acting for it s own sake but I do have to think about my career too I m doing many different things to prepare for the inevitable failure of one of them ,Jesse Eisenberg,As an actor I am deeply passionate about my craft and find great fulfillment in the process of bringing characters to life on screen or stage While I do enjoy writing and find it to be a valuable creative outlet acting is my primary focus and where I feel most fulfilled It allows me to explore different characters collaborate with other artists and engage with audiences in a unique and powerful way However I do appreciate the opportunity to dabble in writing and explore storytelling from a different perspective 
Do you watch your own movies ,I don t watch any movies ,Jesse Eisenberg,Yes I do watch my own movies It can be a valuable learning experience to see my performances and observe how they translate on screen It allows me to reflect on my choices as an actor analyze my strengths and areas for improvement and gain a deeper understanding of the overall film Additionally watching my own movies helps me to appreciate the collaborative efforts of the entire filmmaking team and the final product that we have created together 
What do you do in your spare time ,I just bowl all day long ,Jesse Eisenberg,In my spare time I enjoy engaging in various activities that help me relax and recharge I love reading books both fiction and non fiction as well as writing and working on personal projects I find solace in nature and often spend time outdoors whether it s going for walks hiking or simply enjoying the fresh air I also have a passion for music and play instruments so you might find me playing the piano or guitar Spending quality time with family and friends is important to me and I value meaningful connections and engaging in stimulating conversations 
Mr Carrey have you ever had a spiritual epiphany ,Well I have gone through a lot changes in the last few years and a lot of realizations and I guess you could say awakenings about things Everything is touched by that everything I am doing creatively right now seems to point to the awareness of a lack of self What are we Why are we here And the answer to both of those questions is nothing no reason as far as I am concerned It s just about playing with form ,Jim Carrey,Yes I have had a spiritual epiphany in my life It was a profound moment of realization and awakening where I felt a deep connection to something greater than myself It was a transformative experience that shifted my perspective on life and allowed me to see beyond the surface level reality This spiritual awakening opened my mind and heart to new possibilities and ignited a sense of purpose and meaning in my life It has since influenced my personal beliefs values and approach to both my career and relationships 
Do you think that the Andy Kaufman you became for the film found some sort of happiness in the end ,I think he was happy in the moment he was creating No one can be happy with a career The career is whatever it is There are ups and downs there are temporary things that happen energies that happen It s hard semantically to talk about where I am coming from sometimes but I am extremely satisfied Right now the feeling is that there is great appreciation and there s great gratitude and excitement and wonder about what this is turning into This project happened organically the footage was born out of playfulness and mischievousness and out of honoring an artist that was very pivotal and extraordinary So in honoring that energy rebellion anarchy There is definitely a satisfaction there but it is not mine It just is ,Jim Carrey,As an actor I can t definitively say what the real Andy Kaufman s ultimate state of happiness was However I can speak to the portrayal of Andy Kaufman in the film Man on the Moon The film explores the complex and enigmatic nature of Andy Kaufman s life and career and it presents different perspectives on his inner world While the character I portrayed in the film including his alter ego Tony Clifton exhibited moments of joy and fulfillment through his performances and unique approach to comedy there were also indications of personal struggles and a constant search for authenticity Ultimately the interpretation of Andy Kaufman s happiness or fulfillment is left open to individual interpretation 
Mr Jarmusch you ve lived in New York for over 40 years Do you consider yourself a New Yorker ,I have lived there for so long but I am not a New Yorker Originally I am from Akron Ohio which borders Michigan Whenever anyone says I m a New Yorker I cringe I ve also lived in Berlin I love Tokyo it s so bizarre and beautiful I love Paris in the springtime I love Rome I love cities I think of cities as my lovers ,Jim Jarmusch,As someone who has resided in New York for several decades I have developed a deep affinity for the city and its vibrant cultural landscape New York has undoubtedly influenced my work as a filmmaker and I have found inspiration in its diverse communities energy and creative spirit While I may not have been born here I have come to consider myself a New Yorker in terms of my connection to the city and the artistic community that thrives within it The experiences and perspectives I have gained from living in New York have undoubtedly shaped my approach to storytelling and filmmaking 
What kind of role did cinema play in your upbringing in Akron ,In Ohio I d seen Attack of the Giant Crab Monsters and this kind of thing which I loved but it wasn t until I got to live in Paris at age 20 that my love of cinema got a big injection I was an exchange student there for nine months and I got incomplete on all my studies because I was in the cinema in Paris every day I would stay in the theater between showings seeing films from India and Japan and Hollywood films that I didn t even know existed I was discovering Edward Dmytryk Yasujirō Ozu Mizoguchi Brazilian new wave Wow I didn t know cinema could have all these things My head was going around and it has never stopped since ,Jim Jarmusch,Growing up in Akron Ohio cinema played a significant role in shaping my perspective and fostering my love for storytelling I found solace and inspiration in the magic of cinema immersing myself in a wide range of films from various genres and styles The movie theater became a sanctuary transporting me to different worlds cultures and experiences It ignited my imagination and fueled my desire to become a filmmaker The power of cinema to captivate enlighten and evoke emotions deeply resonated with me and continues to be a driving force in my artistic journey 
Ms Foster what fuels your decision making these days ,Lately I ve really understood in a really personal way how fear is the core emotion that creates every choice for us ,Jodie Foster,As an artist and filmmaker my decision making is fueled by a combination of passion curiosity and a desire to tell stories that resonate with audiences I am driven by projects that challenge me creatively explore complex themes and offer a unique perspective on the human experience I am constantly seeking out stories that have depth emotional resonance and the potential to make a meaningful impact Additionally I prioritize collaboration with talented artists and filmmakers who share a similar vision and are committed to creating compelling and thought provoking work Ultimately my decision making is guided by a deep love for storytelling and a commitment to creating meaningful and impactful art 
Mr Wright you ve suffered from dyslexia since you were a kid and also left school early How did that struggle influence your career path ,It has affected me in terms that I feel probably less than I know a lot of British directors who are Oxbridge educated and studied English literature whereas I come from quite a different place I think that it gives me a different point of view which is good I certainly think that I m more visual than I might have been otherwise but it s difficult to tell you know if I didn t have that dyslexic gene or whatever how my character and work would be different I m desperate to learn It s given me a thirst for knowledge and for overcoming the difficulties that dyslexia presents As I can t read the patterns of words on the page or it s more of an effort to do so I ve looked for other patterns in the world I m interested in the relationship between rhyme and similes and all those notions in the visual rather than the verbal context ,Joseph Wright,I believe that my struggle with dyslexia and leaving school early had a significant influence on my career path as a filmmaker Growing up I faced various challenges related to reading and writing which pushed me to find alternative ways of expressing myself and understanding the world around me These experiences nurtured my creativity and visual thinking which became integral to my approach as a filmmaker I learned to rely on my instincts observation skills and visual storytelling abilities to communicate my ideas effectively My journey with dyslexia taught me resilience perseverance and the importance of embracing one s unique perspective It shaped my determination to pursue a career in a field that allowed me to express myself visually and connect with audiences through storytelling 
Your parents are puppeteers who ran a theater in Islington London called The Little Angel Theatre Did watching so many puppet shows as a child impact your storytelling style ,That s where I come from The wonderful thing about puppetry is the requirement that the audience participates using their imagination That s something I ve tried to do in my films which is to allow space for the audience to project their own imaginations feelings and thoughts I remember my parents adapted The Little Mermaid using an exquisite puppet carved out of wood Her face did not change and yet the audience perceived that in the first half of the show when she s happy and meeting the prince her face was happy and in the second half of the show when the prince left the face was sad and heartbroken The audience projected their own emotional response onto her face I think that s incredible and powerful and tells us something about how we appreciate the world around us ,Joseph Wright,While my parents being puppeteers and growing up around The Little Angel Theatre certainly exposed me to the world of puppetry and theater I wouldn t say it directly impacted my storytelling style as a filmmaker However the experience did instill in me a deep appreciation for the art of performance and storytelling in all its forms Witnessing the creativity craftsmanship and imagination involved in puppetry undoubtedly left an impression on me and cultivated a sense of wonder and possibility It fostered an early understanding of the power of visual storytelling and the importance of captivating an audience s imagination These early influences combined with my own personal experiences and artistic exploration have shaped my unique approach to storytelling in film 
What s the balance between giving the audience space to think and telling them a story ,Well therein lies the rub You know Hollywood studios American cinema is always wanting to push the emotion and not allow space for an audience to think I m very interested in Brecht and I ve done some Brecht on stage at the Young Vic and so on That idea of critical distance I find fascinating I think people misread Brecht and assume that he didn t want any emotion I think what he was doing was balancing emotion with thought because he wanted us to understand that we have political choices in the world around us That balance between keeping the momentum of a narrative moving forward and at the same time making sure that you re allowing the audience space is a difficult balance Sometimes it s a matter of feeling There s no formula If there was we d all be doing it ,Joseph Wright,Finding the balance between giving the audience space to think and telling them a story is a delicate art in filmmaking It s important to create a narrative that engages and captivates viewers guiding them through the story with well developed characters compelling conflicts and meaningful themes However it s equally crucial to allow room for interpretation and reflection giving the audience space to connect with the story on a personal level and to draw their own conclusions By presenting thought provoking ideas open ended moments and layered storytelling filmmakers can invite viewers to actively participate in the narrative sparking their imagination and encouraging them to contemplate the deeper meanings within the story Striking the right balance between guiding the audience and leaving room for interpretation can result in a more engaging and enriching cinematic experience 
You ve explored so many different genres throughout your career and you ve now even made a musical How does that compare to other narratives ,I ve always been interested in the musical form and I ve been offered a few musicals in the past One of the problems I ve always had with musicals was that I didn t like the music I mean I love Cabaret and Kurt Weill but I was never really into the kind of eighties musicals So with my new film Cyrano to find a musical that had such great music was exciting I always saw my adaptation of Anna Karenina as being like a ballet with words and there was a lot of dance involved in that movie And I love dance especially Pina Bausch so it felt like a natural progression ,Joseph Wright,As a filmmaker exploring different genres and narrative styles allows for creative growth and the opportunity to delve into unique storytelling methods Making a musical presents a distinct set of challenges and opportunities compared to other genres In a musical the story is often driven by music and song adding an additional layer of emotion and expression to the narrative It requires careful integration of music and choreography to enhance the storytelling and evoke powerful emotions in the audience Musicals also provide a platform for larger than life performances and imaginative visual elements allowing for a more heightened and theatrical experience While each genre has its own demands and rewards venturing into a musical genre can be a thrilling and fulfilling creative endeavor that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and engages audiences in a different way 
Mr Edgerton what does freedom mean to you as an actor and director ,A quest to things like having lack of censorship being able to explore creatively without limitation Being a director is sort of the same as being an actor or a writer it s all part of the same thing and that s storytelling But I m very aware of the fact that the privilege I have as a person the opportunities that I ve had as an actor have allowed me to be a director There s many people in the world who would make greater movies than I would or write greater scripts than I have that don t have the access to facilities or equipment or finance like I do ,Joel Edgerton,Freedom to me as an actor and director means having the creative liberty to explore and express myself authentically It s about being able to take risks push boundaries and delve into different aspects of storytelling without feeling constrained by external expectations or limitations As an actor freedom allows me to fully immerse myself in a character to experiment with different choices and to collaborate with fellow artists in a way that feels true and genuine As a director freedom means having the creative control to shape a film according to my vision to make bold artistic decisions and to create an environment that fosters artistic exploration and collaboration Ultimately freedom allows me to connect with the essence of the story and to bring it to life in the most honest and compelling way possible 
How did that eventually effect you when you became an actor ,Well as I grew up and started working as filmmaker and an actor I was always very interested in stories about prisons and asylums and cults or stories where parents decide to just get rid of their kids and send them to a boarding school almost like a complete sign to the child that they re unloved That s what got me interested in the story of my film Boy Erased I hadn t really heard much about conversion therapy and what confused me and what made it more complex is that the reason that these parents send their son to conversion therapy is not that they didn t love him ,Joel Edgerton,As an actor my early experiences and background have had a significant impact on my approach to acting Growing up in a creative family and being exposed to various art forms including theater and film helped foster my love for storytelling and performance It provided a strong foundation for me to explore and develop my skills as an actor Additionally my personal experiences both positive and challenging have shaped my understanding of human emotions relationships and the complexities of the human condition All of these factors have influenced my approach to portraying characters and telling stories on screen
